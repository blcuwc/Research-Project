1281066004	  Read up on that and some people have an intolerance to green tea that causes this, grr... so back to coffee I ended up going. 	NEGATIVE

2015366979	  Cats are obligate carnivores after all. 	NEUTRAL
2104219107	  There is likely a psychological connection, but it seems that there must be a physical connection, too, since the cat does this somewhat if something is really rich, like muffins, which I haven't had in forever since I haven't figured out how to make gluten free.	NEUTRAL

506218659	  I know that both have to be roasted in order to use them, too.	NEUTRAL
2022711636	You are both right actually I was reading about this recently as well that it is actually the protein in the coffee that causes this. 	NEUTRAL

1530688725	  But the caffeine habit is hard to break because I get the physical addiction of a headache, nausea, fatigue. 	NEGATIVE
1093819964	  So what I am going to do this week is cut out the coffee/tea etc and if I get a caffeine headache, take an Excendrin for Tension headaches. 	NEUTRAL
2083472814	(that has tylenol/caffeine 65 mg) and just ween myself that way. 	NEUTRAL
675681116	  It's obvious this is causing a reaction so using coffee to ween isn't helping. 	NEGATIVE

13370972	  It makes me feel better.	POSITIVE
684200588	I am allergic to coffee, but bc it has a high content of nickel (which I'm allergic to). 	NEGATIVE
1274494904	  If you notice feeling sick after eating other nickel-high foods (beans, chocolate, peas, whole wheats)...or if you react when wearing cheap jewlry, you may want to get tested for nickel allergy.	NEUTRAL
616254719	Another note...tea is also high in nickel and fish....you should get tested for allergies....	NEUTRAL
319497283	I've recently become very intolerant because of an increase in nickel in my body (as I got a body implant)...so now every time I'm exposed to nickel (even in medications, and even aspirin I react....	NEGATIVE

1310715425	Great resource betbri, I never knew about metal allergies. 	POSITIVE
1761008975	  Nor did I realize it has a high content of nickel in it. 	NEUTRAL
2007254804	  That is very interesting indeed. 	POSITIVE
1508778260	  I actually had some of the metals removed from my mouth and replaced with white fillings. 	NEUTRAL

1929304761	  Did you do the Melisa test betbri or just go to your allergy doctor to be tested?	NEUTRAL

1040177429	so I will list them and hope it helps you two, and possibly someone else reading this :)Doctors are very much unaware of metal allergies in the US (versus other countries that have done loads of research and some countries test every patient for metal allergy before putting fillings, implants in).	POSITIVE
1333177429	According to study after study, around 10% of the population is allergic to nickel (with a higher percentage of women affected).	NEGATIVE
1764592183	If a person is allergic to one metal, it's over 50% of those that are allergic to 2 or 3 metals (so it's important to be tested until you rule out allergy to multiple metals).	NEGATIVE
1276742411	Eating certain food for someone allergic to metal causes illness (not just skin rashes to jewelry).	NEUTRAL
1438146650	It's very important when suspecting an allergy to medications to look at the INACTIVE ingredients in pills.  	NEUTRAL
385839648	For instance I have a list of meds I'm allergic to... 	NEUTRAL
652765309	and the docs just put "allergic to aspirin, wellbutrin, etc..." when in reality the one common element in all I'm allergic to is certain types of metal in the coating.  	NEGATIVE
303415921	You're doctor will not help figure out your REAL allergy... 	NEGATIVE
1401109051	because almost no one is actually allergic to the active ingredients in pills, but doctors only list the pill your allergic to and don't ask what it is about those pills you are allergic to. 	NEUTRAL
1546256257	You can test allergic to foods that contain metals (brocolli, chocoate, whole wheat, etc...) and again, it may be that you're allergic to those food because of a metal or additive added....so if a person is allergic to multiple foods it's important to rule out the possibility of a common element in all of them.	NEGATIVE
815904654	It has been a harsh reality to release that you have to be your own advocate, and that doctors many times don't test for things for those with chronic issues that can't pinpoint exacty what's wrong.  	NEGATIVE
1176256428	I went in to food allergists many years ago that literally wouldn't test me for allergies because they didn't think I had enough "evidence" that I was allergic.  	NEUTRAL
1537848667	For those of us with chronic fatigue and "vague" symptoms like stomach aches, migraines, etc....	NEGATIVE
53998922	it's very unlikely that a doctor would order a whole battery of testing to rule out the many many illnesses that could cause these things.So....	NEUTRAL
2098053457	please....if you are a person that has skin reactions when you wear certain jewelry, or have chronic acne and rash on face from makeup (which contains high amounts of metal), or react when eating food high in metal content (nuts, many veggies, coffe....) then please do yourself a favor and order the Melissa test yourself!   	NEGATIVE
932573176	A doctor will literally look at you like you're nuts or a hypocondriac if you tell him/her that you think you're allergic to metal. 	NEGATIVE
1996368303	(I told all my doctors when they ask at the beginning of appointments when I'm allergic to that I'm allergic to metal and they literally don't put it in my records...	NEUTRAL
818690629	many say things like "no...	NEUTRAL
1450954184	I mean like medications and food...	NEUTRAL
1124307172	not skin reaction to jewelry.)  	POSITIVE
2002230195	This has been a long road for me and it wasn't until I got all of my medical records for myself and noticed the correlations for myself and ordered the metal allergy test without a doctor willing to order for me, 	NEUTRAL
38991541	that I was able to confirm the source of all my illness...	POSITIVE
1247300863	so...even though it's a harsh reality, it seems that especially those with chronic, multiple ailments have to be their own advocate and in my case (and I'm assuming for others) take matters into our own hands after being told by docts that there's nothing wrong and "it may be just normal for you to be tired"....	POSITIVE
1233585857	Sorry for the crazy long post!  	NEGATIVE
1823398424	 But I hope these few facts help someone else out there, to shorten their road to recovery because it took me so long to figure this out!	NEUTRAL
2128242225	Melisa.org has a great section of medical journals that talk about many things in regards to metal allergy...	NEGATIVE
632287419	probably the best place for anyone to start...	NEUTRAL
1174326556	I am definitely glad you spoke up about this. 	NEUTRAL
1560385991	  I do get skin reactions from certain metals. 	POSITIVE
1069275615	  One in particular was a natural makeup I had started to use which was Bare Essentials. 	NEUTRAL
1194507256	  They advertise it as being completely natural etc.  but what was interesting was that I used it and every time I used it I would get very itchy on skin to the point where I couldn't stand it. 	NEUTRAL
108372539	  Come to find out it has Bismuth in it and there are a lot of makeups out there that do have this.	NEGATIVE
301921109	http://makeup.lovetoknow.com/Allergy_to_Mineral_Makeup 	NEUTRAL
455739995	As soon as I stopped using it the issue cleared up right away.	NEUTRAL
657558651	And yes we do have to be our own advocates.  	NEUTRAL
501989083	We have to pay attention to what we ingest and encounter and if it does cause an issue, we need to stay away from it.  	NEUTRAL
726135070	If only caffeine was easy to stay away from :(	NEUTRAL
695886759	This is interesting to me about the mineral make-up. 	NEGATIVE
1787495488	  I hadn't thought of this at all, but metals are considered to be minerals. 	NEUTRAL
565192801	  I haven't looked up the above link, but what I was thinking of was that a friend used some on me--once. 	POSITIVE
1703960065	  I didn't get the severe allergic reactions that people who get rashes from metals would probably get, but I did get a bit itchy. 	NEGATIVE
740943601	  The thing is, I can wear the cheap costume jewelry metals, like the metal watchband that I have that I know my cousins with metal allergies can't wear. 	NEUTRAL
2099491864	  But, the cheap ear wires and other costume jewelry metals do bother my ears a little. 	NEUTRAL
1234231342	  So, I do switch out the ear wires to the sterling silver and the gold filled slightly more expensive ear wires. 	POSITIVE
8763782392	  I am fine with these, but I know my cousins are still not fine with these, and neither is someone else I know who can only wear pure yellow gold. 	NEGATIVE
6352728193	  So, she doesn't have a whole lot of jewelry that she wears regularly because of this.	NEGATIVE
1989475036	What I'm wondering is if the milder reaction I get from the cheap ear wires is more of a sensitivity to nickel and other cheaper metals, or is it something else?	NEUTRAL
1474854232		NEUTRAL
132943231	Look at Melisa.org and do some research on metal allergies....you could be a great help to those you know who are getting reactions to jewlry....some poeple are allergic to titanium, some to silver, some gold....most commonly people are allergic to nickel....which represents 10% of the population who are allergic. 	NEGATIVE
495028091	  A large number of people allergic to metals are allergic to multiple types of metal....so a reaction to just cheap jewelry probably indicates a nickel allergy. 	NEUTRAL
1861523350	it is important to note that almost all things made of metal are alloys...	NEUTRAL
129283945	meaning it is a mix of metal. 	NEGATIVE
1705838709	  For instance, I had a copper IUD that caused me to have 13 cysts within 2 months of insertion....turns out there was nickel in it also..	NEUTRAL
226919767	The important thing to note is that many people don't respond with significant health problems until they get metal inserted in the body....such as cavity filings...	NEGATIVE
1254956611	contrast given for MRI's....so it is so important to be aware of the allergy and know to ask what includes metal or not....however, the impact a person may feel when having a metal allergy and being exposed through jewelry, deoderant, make up, toothpaste, candy.....is unknown.  	NEGATIVE
1467539331	 Before I had a back implant I was sluggish and sick often...	NEUTRAL
1891875383	turns out it was undiagnosed allergy to metal. 	NEUTRAL
1111415162	I was just ordered to get an MRI with contrast...	NEUTRAL
656051308	being extra careful i asked if there was metal in the contrast, I was told there was no metal.  	NEGATIVE
1054355901	For some reason I thought that I should make sure...	NEGATIVE
299190381	turns out there is a very high metal content!  	NEUTRAL
1397950897	The doctor and even tech administering the contrast had no idea, but the main active ingredient in metal and many contrast solution in nickel based or copper based...	NEUTRAL
2134041587	given that the nickel content in a piece of chocolate cake can send my heart rate up to 130, I hate to think of what could have happened had I taken the doctor's word that there was no metal in the contrast!	NEUTRAL
1207916771	Don't worry. 	NEUTRAL
238359850	  I will find out more. 	NEUTRAL
409444519	  I do know about the white gold, for example, because a friend with metal allergies found out that white gold still has metal alloys in it. 	NEUTRAL
857911515	  She can't wear the white gold because of the alloys. 	NEUTRAL
1127112609	  I don't understand why doctors assume that a skin allergy to metals isn't serious enough to consider that taking the stuff internally would still be bad. 	NEUTRAL
779679723	  I mean, the whole reason the skin scratch tests work as tests is because the skin is reacting to something the whole body is allergic to. 	NEGATIVE
1660379540	  And, the skin is the largest organ in the body. 	NEUTRAL
180789881	  It just happens to be on the outside. 	NEUTRAL
1128884081	  I did look at the MELISA site. 	NEUTRAL
1701777892	  I plan on sending the link to a cousin of mine, since she and all of her sisters are allergic to metals. 	NEGATIVE
2117334290	  They may not be aware of the food allergy connection. 	POSITIVE
1872848743	  I have a lot of sensitivities versus allergies. 	NEGATIVE
490551374	  Now I'm beginning to wonder if the milder reaction I get from cheap ear wires, whether nickel or stainless steel, is connected to the food sensitivities. 	NEGATIVE
1431072614	  I will definitely be on guard and not allow any metal devices to be inserted in my body, since I have sensitivities.	NEGATIVE
1774739970		NEUTRAL
1594666414	What is comical and also something to think about is when you get dental work done. 	NEUTRAL
78135332	   About 6 months ago I had a root canal done on a back tooth, the dentist had file separation occur while performing the procedure.W	NEGATIVE
311294565	hat is file separation I asked--- and he calmly explains to me that the drill broke off into my root system.  	NOT_LABELED

95066028	There is very little online about the type of coffee allergy I've been experiencing but in doing some initial research, it looks like this is developing over time and perhaps its not an actual caffeine allergy as it is something to do with the coffee or it's processing methods. 	NEUTRAL

1518247415	musician and I enjoy a healthy lifestyle ( balanced diet + daily exercise). 	NEUTRAL
1007291175	My health is good except for a recently diagnosed intolerance to Tyramine. 	POSITIVE
1731111567	For ex. 	POSITIVE
1560402865	if i eat a few slices of salami on an empty stomach it will trigger an attack, which is always the same : i get a really fast heartbeat + increased blood pressure + nausea 15 mn after ingestion. 	POSITIVE
1248672972	Sometimes the heart palpitations last for 1/2 h ( 120-130 bpm), and the nausea + lightheadedness will last for a day, it depends on the type of food, if i am tired etc... I am 99% sure the culprit is Tyramine, which is a natural amine found in all foods but much higher in foods that are aged, fermented, pickled  ( salami, cheese, sauerkraut, smoked salmon, anchovy paste ), in foods that have been stored for a long time ( nuts, dried fruits) and also in overripe fruits like bananas, oranges and avocados.

886490434	I did a lot of research, started an elimination diet and asked many doctors before a neurologist mentioned the cheese migraine symptoms to me. 	NEUTRAL
244679455	Later I found a list of Tyramine loaded foods in which I recognized every single food that had triggered an attack after I ingested it. 	POSITIVE
42412741	There is no test to confirm my theory but since I eliminated these Tyramine loaded foods from my diet I feel much better and less terrified of eating, and I am even putting some weight back on ( 112 lbs for 5’4”). 	NEUTRAL
503553727	 Soon hopefully I will feel strong enough to start reintroducing these foods into my diet in very small quantities to get myself desensitized, unless of course one day I wake up free of this strange condition that appeared for no reason and might disappear the same way.	POSITIVE
1950946105	  I guess what is very puzzling to me is the fact that this sensitivity appeared out of the blue, that the symptoms are so violent and that I DO NOT get migraines.	NEUTRAL
597629535	 People who have problems with foods high in Tyramine usually are either migraine sufferers and/or on antidepressant ( MAOs).	NEUTRAL
992474044	 I do not take any medication and my symptoms are always exactly the same 5 to 10 mn after ingesting the culprit food : tachycardia + hypertension + tremors + nausea and sometimes light headache when the attack is really bad.	NEUTRAL
2125642237	 After having had about 14 attacks within the last 12 months it is such a relief to be able to eat again! 	NEUTRAL

1593549554	For the last year or so, I have been having horrible sharp pains in my stomach and right abdomen after eating meat- usually I only get it with pork and beef- I have not noticed any problems with whole fish(I only eat the whole imported mackerel we have at work)  and some chicken. 	POSITIVE
859070452	   The pains usually give me severe stomach cramps for the next few days- even after I have passed it out. 	NEGATIVE
1255093517	  At first I tried to rule it out as me eating too much meat and making myself constipated, but I limited it to one day a week eating meat and switching the meats to see if it was possible an allergic reaction to a certain kind of meat. 	NEGATIVE
1511392633	 Last night I was eating a small amount of beef and started getting these pains, I didn't finish eating because I felt like I was going to throw up and I had hives and my lymph nodes were swollen (I had my boyfriend double check to make sure I wasn't just imagining it) and he told me my whole torso and only my torso was extremely hot to the touch.	POSITIVE
690707569	.   I was reluctant to go to the ER because I cannot afford it, so I took some bennadryl and stuck my head in the window to get fresh air so I could breathe- it worked after about half an hour of tunnel vision.	NEUTRAL

1694017081	Last night after eating a small amount of eggs my tongue started to go numb and tingle- then it felt huge and heavy and i could not keep it in my mouth. 	NEUTRAL
57053283	  I looked in the mirror and saw a red dot on the tip of my tongue that was not normally there and my tongue kind of hurt and looked swollen. 	POSITIVE
701781316	  I could breathe ok, but it took almost three hours for my tongue to fit back into my mouth and half that time the numbness had faded to the front of the tongue. 	NEUTRAL
31129456522	  Today I still cannot feel the very tip of my tongue and the red dot is gone, but I have a lisp that I cannot get rid of that I did not have before- it's very alarming. 	POSITIVE
1513278647	  I heard that it could have been an allergy to the meat, a protein intolerance, vitamin b12 deficiency or it could be something like MS. 	NEUTRAL

1051639369	  I have always had a sensitive stomach though so I just attributed it to this. 	NEGATIVE
1468855953	  I do eat meat when I am pregnant as that is what my body craves but yes it's hard on my digestive system and I still have to take breaks from it. 	NEGATIVE
1679824851	  Keep us updated on this, I'm certainly curious what you find out or discover.	NEUTRAL
2038935498	Hi, I'd probably see an allergist because although I'm not a doctor, my children have anaphylaxis to different foods and what you describe may have been a life-threatening situation. 	NEGATIVE
1007396349	  The hot to the touch, swelling of the tongue are all immediate reactions and the subsequent ones are probably delayed .. 	NEUTRAL
2035003929	the immediate ones can progress and without an epi-pen one may not be able to reverse the process with Benadryl alone. 	POSITIVE
1550074943	Also, after taking Benadryl in situation as you describe, our allergist has told us to be very careful 4-6hrs later when the Benadryl wears off -- to be wary of a rebound effect that can be worse than the initial allergic reaction. 	NEUTRAL
978639259	Meat and eggs are two real items to be careful about .... I hope you feel better soon ... 	NEUTRAL
1132723300	C~	NEUTRAL
1779247843	Thank you both for your responses- I didn't know the allergies could get that bad. 	NEUTRAL

1810029893	  My tongue is still swollen slightly so I lisp my words trying to say them clear, so I will defiantly take the advice of going to an allergist because its been almost a week. 	POSITIVE
5262858	  Also- thank you for the tip about the epi-pen- my boyfriend said something about me carrying one too, I think that is defiantly something I will have to get- I defiantly don't want to have to go to the ER with a relapse symptom. 	POSITIVE
1031400274	  I will post after I see an allergist.	NEUTRAL
1128156252	Hi, My daughter carries an epi pen because bee stings cause her tongue to swell! 	NEUTRAL

886360443	I don't know if this will help at all either, but my mother-in-law has an allergy to sesame that causes this. 	NEUTRAL
278001608	  She eats meat, but there are a lot of things that include cooking with sesame that give her an allergic reaction right away. 	NEUTRAL
1734916913	  So maybe check some of the things that you ate or see if this is something that has been an ingredient that bothers you. 	NEUTRAL
986454665	  I know you mentioned you didn't have health insurance, so I thought I would share with you that she also carries around liquid Benadryl in case she accidentally eats something with sesame in it. 	NEUTRAL
2037456799	  It seems to help her quicker than the tablets. 	NEUTRAL
189068012	  She developed this when she was about 40.	POSITIVE
233651088	Oh --- mention to your Grandmother that Benadryl now makes the liquid in take-along spoons (for kids actually) that she can adjust the dosing accordingly. 	POSITIVE
532073584	  I wish they had this when my kids were small -- I used to use a syringe med dropper and carry one ready-to-go in a plastic ziploc bag and needless to say, it did get messy at times! 	POSITIVE

1894914506	I get a stomach ache alot after eating chicken or beef (two more allergies of mine) I mean, I can take just two bites, and wham-o, the tummy pain begins. 	NEUTRAL
2118552042	Other times, however, I do not get the pain, it is so weird. 	NEUTRAL
1721320560	You know, I think a lot of times, for me at least, it is all the "additives" they are putting into our food. 	NEUTRAL
297887411	There are so many "chemicals" now, and no one really knows if they are allergic to them until it is too late.	NEUTRAL
1438218903	Oh, yes, Benadryl really will help. 	NEGATIVE
235242124	  Sometimes a bit of breakthrough burning with the GERD will occur because of the food sensitvities, even though I'm pretty careful. 	NEUTRAL
53208967	  Benadryl really helps with this, too. 	NEUTRAL
317194806	  It also helps when I get that slight feeling like I'm trying to swallow a hard rubber ball I get from all these allergies. 	NEGATIVE
1234376236	  I hadn't thought of buying the liquid, but even the adult pills will work for me. 	NEUTRAL
854229928	  It just takes longer, as was mentioned. 	NEGATIVE
1017964497	  I have to stick with what I can afford, but I do understand the reasoning for the liquid. 	NEUTRAL
498975624	Benadryl works much better than Zyrtec and Clariten which are better suited, as I understand and told to me by my kids, for seasonal and indoor allergies v food. 	POSITIVE

1656600162	  Well, actually, that's over-simplifying GERD. 	POSITIVE
24045149	  I took the Benadryl, because it's better than reaching for the PPI meds that shut off the stomach acid and are so bad for a person's health when used long-term. 	POSITIVE
1833470795	  They actually cause the stomach to start churning out even more acid in the long run, too, because the stomach will notice the missing acid and over compensate. 	NEUTRAL
