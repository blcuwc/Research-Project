651514332	Hi, Breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex.	FACT
1308334390	Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy; they do not need to be aspirated unless they are too large and causing discomfort.	FACT
1700511941	However a complex cyst is more concerning because it will on occasion be an intracystic cancer.	FACT
1448128037	These type of cysts are also fluid filled sacs but contain a good percentage of solid elements, like old blood or debris.	FACT
1046850526	Usually complex cysts are aspirated and the cells examined under the microscope to better evaluate their nature and to rule out cancer.	FACT
2108873182	 A fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure and you shouldn’t be scared because the site to be biopsied will be numbed with a local anesthetic.	FACT

1410607360	Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
815642281	It’s rather unusual to have cancer in both breasts, but unfortunately it can occur and I am really sorry that this happened to you.	OPINION
960433479	Even if you are one of the few women to experience cancer bilaterally, the scenario isn't as dire as it sounds.	OPINION
1423803463	Many studies have shown that a woman's prognosis is not necessarily worse if she has breast cancer in both breasts, and that the outcomes in such cases are often excellent.	FACT
888965391	Although each breast may require a different treatment strategy, the overall treatment for breast cancer in both breasts is no different than for cancer that occurs in just one breast.	FACT
180248256	The good thing is that the tumor in your right breast is rather small and is ER/PR positive which will respond well to medication, such as Tamoxifen or other similar drugs to lower considerably the risk of recurrence.	OPINION
894201732	The tumor in your left breast is Grade 1 which is also a good thing.	OPINION
818386018	It’s going to be a long journey but don’t be disheartened.	OPINION
655754989	Take one step at a time, follow your Doctor’s recommendation and I am sure you’ll be able to beat this disease like many of us did.	OPINION
319088625	Wishing you all the best and successful outcome.	OPINION
1674073552	Hi, ER (Estrogen) and PR (Progesterone) receptor status tests are done to show whether or not one or both of those hormones fuel your tumor.	FACT
56016538	Estrogen positive, even if it’s weak, medication such as Tamoxifen (or other similar drugs) is usually recommended to lower the risk of recurrence in the same breast and helps prevent new cancer in the opposite breast.	FACT
2117673992	 Cancer that is hormone-sensitive is slightly slower growing and has a better chance of responding to hormone-suppression drugs, than cancer that is hormone receptor negative.	FACT
1310647909	 HER-2/neu negative cancer is also a good thing, because it is considered less aggressive than HER-2 positive.	FACT
2091279072	 I am sure that your Doctors will explain all this to you in details, when you’ll meet them.	OPINION

369657961	Hi  I just did a follow up ultra sound, on a lump that my radiologist had been following for a year and a half.	EXPERIENCE
1094484228	 My results said that it grew and changed from 5mm to 9mm diagnoses bi raids 4  so i had the biopsy doctor calls and said that tissues are benign.	EXPERIENCE
699794779	  Then he proceeds to tell me that i have a intraductal papilloma 9mm.	EXPERIENCE
604850318	 he then stated that i need and excisional biopsy  time to see a breast surgent,  during the conversation he stated that it is very rare that these are cancer only a 5% chance.	EXPERIENCE
1008018793	  So my questions is can i leave this alone i prefer to just follow it?	FACT
1895255908	  If i left it in and it did turn to cancer what could the outcome be how dangerous could it get even if i am being followed.	FACT

1092709910	5% may not seem much of a chance to you but even a 1% chance would send me to a Breast Surgeon immediately.	OPINION

355276762	The follow-up plan seems very appropriate and I would be comfortable with that myself.	OPINION
1660980221	I do think it wise to go ahead with the second opinion to further clear things in your mind.	OPINION
2137316482	The hematoma issue isn't at all unusual in such circumstances with biopsies but it can complicate the situation.	OPINION
1144677266	Remember that the decision you make today or 3 months from now won't necessarily change the outcome.	OPINION
1055770250	Even though papilloma can be cancer, if there is only one they are usually watched for a period of time.	FACT
893162685	You're on the right track but try not to confuse yourself by doing TOO much research as no 2 cases are the same and you can't depend too much on percentages, they are too general.	OPINION

1690285322	Hi I went for my second opinion, Not sure what to make of the appointment though.	EXPERIENCE
1495894517	This doctor is a top breast Sergent in my area, She actually did my first breast surgery in 2008.	EXPERIENCE
1120336500	  When i saw her i felt like she was a little pushy,  She said to me it grew and surgery  was the best route even though i do not have any of the symptoms and the biopsy came back benign.	EXPERIENCE
1641269773	She quoted to me (Pathology report too consider excision.)	EXPERIENCE
1455101857	When i ask questions i felt like she thought i was stupid and she did not want to answer questions she cut me off, proceeded to tell me two options surgery or follow every six months.	EXPERIENCE
549740687	 My question which i think is important does anyone know?	OPINION
806168849	Are there any studies of women who were follow with intraductal papilloma what is the long term out come.	FACT
426713677	That's too bad that you had a less than comfortable experience with the Breast Surgeon; perhaps she was having a bad day ????	OPINION
514655684	At this point since the chance of a single papilloma being malignant is rather small you might as well follow it for the recommended 6 months.	OPINION
214807745	This all began the last of November and you should count the 6 months from that date and see what is recommended at your next check-up which would be in the Spring.	OPINION
2136290454	If at that time it is determined to be benign then it can be left alone.	OPINION
888451255	On the other hand if you are "done" with all the re-checks and possible biopsies then have it removed and over with.	OPINION
97086927	It all comes down to what you are comfortable with.	OPINION

2081141412	That does seem rather a long time but it depends upon exactly what your normal activity consists of, like strenuous exercise which would not be wise or several other things that would  put undue strain on muscles, etc.	OPINION
595270619	I would increase your activities very gradually but NEVER go against the advice of the Surgeon.	OPINION

1856706048	When I went in for my mammogram, I was told that my benign scattered calcifications that I had for the last 2 years were misread and are actually fine, linear calcifications, but because they were stable for 2 years they told me to come back in 6 months.	EXPERIENCE
1113876556	 They gave me a BI RADS 3.	EXPERIENCE
1181561008	 When I got my report, my breast density was reported as extremely dense.	EXPERIENCE
247194292	 I have always had heterogeneously dense breasts.	EXPERIENCE
591339982	 I have since done a lot of googling and cannot understand why they wouldn't biopsy.	EXPERIENCE
1712694390	 I have found out that DCIS can be stable for a while and that the morphology is more important than the stability over time.	FACT
1506275081	 Why would they wait!	OPINION
130590630	 I am so scared!	OPINION
192907486	 Do they know what they are doing?	FACT
911976719	Thoughts please?	NOT_LABELED
795942794	Hi.	FACT
1728031891	 Experienced Radiologists are quite able to identify typically benign breast calcifications depending on their form and pattern.	FACT
396543077	If no suspicion is detected a biopsy is not required to prevent unnecessary procedures.	FACT
1297218234	 BIRADS Category 3, means that the findings have a very high probability of being benign, therefore  recommending a short-interval follow-up.	OPINION
1548623475	I wouldn't worry so much if I were you, because what your radiologist has recommended is standard procedure.	OPINION
365160667	If these calcification were suspicious in any way, I am sure a biopsy would have certainly been ordered.	OPINION
1724281747	 But of course this is up to you to decide….if you still feel uncomfortable waiting six months for a follow up, you could always have your films read by another Radiologist for a second opinion, or ask your Doctor to order a biopsy.	OPINION

246137679	Thank you for your answer.	NOT_LABELED
994107068	 I don't understand why I have to have a mammogram in 6 months.	OPINION
1677336066	 Why can't I just get one in 1 year?	OPINION
1574494696	 I don't think BI RADS 3 is very useful to have to spend the extra money to watch something that is benign.	OPINION
1681805608	 When will I ever go back to once a year mammograms?	FACT
1230290186	Hi again, You have been asked to have these calcification monitored every 6 month simply because when the radiologist assigns calcifications to a "probably benign" category, the risk of malignancy even if very low ( less than 2%) can change unexpectedly.	FACT
431371336	Typically these calcifications will be monitored every six months for at least one year.	FACT
351295205	Assuming that no new changes are found, your doctor will recommend you have a routine mammogram once a year.	FACT
171623310	I hope that you’ll follow your doctor’s recommendation to make sure there is no change in the size, shape or number of calcifications.	OPINION
1678936428	My calcifications have already been stable for over 2 years.	EXPERIENCE
2003899890	 Can you show me any resource that says if a radiologist sees fine, linear calcifications to "wait and see" for six months?	FACT
1483380640	  If they want them stable for a year, I have been stable for more than 2 years.	FACT
329263696	 I have not seen 1 resource where it is recommended that fine, linear calcifications be put in the BI RADS 3 or 2 categories.	OPINION
1099817452	 My mammograms have all been the same, the only difference is that the radiologists have misread them.	EXPERIENCE
2966762292	 Thank you	NOT_LABELED
1818710939	If the calcifications can change unexpectedly, then is the risk still less than 2%?	FACT
102130753	 If they haven't changed in 2 years, what is the risk they will change in 2 1/2 years, 3 years, ect...?	FACT
1501818390	I really cannot say why your Radiologist asked you to follow-up in 6 months since your calcifications have been stable for 2 years.	FACT
1372066530	Linear calcification is not always indicative of malignancy.	FACT
286367704	The suspicion is raised only when they are clustered and appear to form several branches.	FACT
1569854859	When they are linear but detached, such as probably yours are, it’s usually not worrisome but they have to be monitored regularly.	FACT
2092426263	I wish I could give you more information about the things you are requesting here, but the only advice I can give you is to have your Mammogram films read by a different Radiologist for a second opinion and also to have your test report explained to you in details by your Doctor who is your best source of information.

836067605	I don't want to go through chemotherapy, I am willing to do radiation along with hepercin  will this  help me at all?	FACT
1863446660	I think what the doctor is trying to tell you is that surgery in your case is necessary, and which you now say you had.	OPINION
2004562029	He also said that especially if lymph nodes are involved, chemotherapy is highly recommended and the right way to go in your case.	OPINION
1961621684	It will not guarantee that you will live forever but it will increase your chances of living longer.	FACT
37032338	I do understand what you are saying, after all mt tests from the muga scan to the mri bone scat and cat scan.	FACT
481548035	Blood work and so on, after all the tests came back would the doctors know if the cance has spresd to other area outside of my lymph nodes?	FACT
72493	Hi.	NOT_LABELED
103258448	 If the cancer has been found in the lymph nodes, there is a significant probability that there is already microscopic spread to other areas of the body.	FACT
595987251	 This microscopic spread may not be easily detected by conventional imaging procedures.	FACT
669179545	 So even if the initial tests were negative for distant metastases, if the lymph nodes are already involved, it is imperative to do some additional treatment like chemotherapy, since we are not sure that the negative results are totally reliable.	FACT
1176941028	Is there a time lime to have chemotherapy?,	FACT
581871935	right now I am unable to have the chemotherapy due to financial reason.	FACT
1720485447	I am not counting it out all together maybe sometime next year?	FACT
2016512704	This is what I have been told.	EXPERIENCE
1934410799	When you are first diagnosed, a team of doctors set up your treatment plan. (	FACT
1154697713	or a doctor/doctors talk about what they think is the best thing to do in any particular case for the best possible outcome and prevention of reoccurrence.)	FACT
138194740	Then , if the patient agrees to this, you go ahead with it.	FACT
1201545935	If you do, then the initial treatments are really the most important of all the treatment, as the goal is to wipe out whatever cancer there is and may be lurking the very first time.	FACT
1597602703	If you decide to do chemo a year or so later, this will no longer be part of the initially recommended treatment that according to the doctor's best judgement has the highest chance of working in your best interest.	FACT
1893726723	Radiation will certainly help with reoccurrence, and it will attack whatever may have spread outside of the surgical area that was removed.	FACT
1925896154	But as the doctor above explains, with positive lymph nodes there is a chance that the cancer has spread, and in half of the cases those lesions are so tiny that they won't show up on a bone scan or other test.	FACT
44162754	So, this is why chemotherapy is utilized to make sure that if this spread is there it is wiped out by chemo immediately, because after the first chance the cancer will only spread and grow. (	FACT
1432263948	I mean even with radiation, it will grow outside of the radiation area.)	FACT
154584627	Radiation is local treatment just like surgery, and chemo is systemic.	FACT
1690568799	So is tamoxifen but  it's not indicated in your case.	FACT
28363907	Do not put off chemo because of financial reasons.	OPINION
225524585	There are breast cancer advocate organizations that can help you get treatment.	FACT
177959985	I think one of them is called youcanthrive.org, or something close to that.	OPINION
185245756	Find an advocate and get the treatment you need.	FACT
664344341	Your LIFE is more important than financial considerations.	OPINION
768772863	NOBODY in this country should have to risk recurrence of a life threatening disease because they can't afford treatment.	OPINION
813046622	I had Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in 09.	EXPERIENCE
433206050	Treatment included 2 lumpectomies, chemotherapy and radiation.	EXPERIENCE
2085510238	When cancer reaches your lymph nodes, you have no idea where the cancer cells have traveled through your body, therefore chemotherapy treatment is necessary.	FACT
765918576	Do you know of any more of the advocate and financial support groups?	FACT

106241957	 My doctor said that she has seen a few patients live for 10 years in this condition.	EXPERIENCE
1605567116	 The danger is that the cancer will move to vital organs.	FACT
