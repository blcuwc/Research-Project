651514332	Hi, Breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex.	NEUTRAL
1308334390	Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy; they do not need to be aspirated unless they are too large and causing discomfort.	NEUTRAL
1700511941	However a complex cyst is more concerning because it will on occasion be an intracystic cancer.	NEUTRAL
1448128037	These type of cysts are also fluid filled sacs but contain a good percentage of solid elements, like old blood or debris.	NEUTRAL
1046850526	Usually complex cysts are aspirated and the cells examined under the microscope to better evaluate their nature and to rule out cancer.	NEUTRAL
2108873182	 A fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure and you shouldn’t be scared because the site to be biopsied will be numbed with a local anesthetic.	NEUTRAL
1061058322	Please take my advice and call your Doctor to reschedule the FNA biopsy ASAP so you can have peace of mind.	NEUTRAL

257515149	Unless you have had another Ultrasound test there is no way for you to know whether you have the same lump or not.	NEUTRAL
1905944761	Obviously you are still not willing to do as your Doctors have advised since you seem to be coming up with any excuse not to have the recommended biopsy.	NEGATIVE

599516619	Japdip has already advised you that if your Radiologist recommended a biopsy, you should, by all means, follow his/her advice ASAP to make sure that there is nothing serious.	NEUTRAL

390086057	This lump could be anything and not necessarily breast cancer.	NEUTRAL
709687145	Please understand that we are not doctors and if we can't answer your questions it's because we simply don't know what else to say except to have the biopsy.	NEUTRAL

1410607360	Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
815642281	It’s rather unusual to have cancer in both breasts, but unfortunately it can occur and I am really sorry that this happened to you.	NEGATIVE
960433479	Even if you are one of the few women to experience cancer bilaterally, the scenario isn't as dire as it sounds.	POSITIVE
1423803463	Many studies have shown that a woman's prognosis is not necessarily worse if she has breast cancer in both breasts, and that the outcomes in such cases are often excellent.	POSITIVE
888965391	Although each breast may require a different treatment strategy, the overall treatment for breast cancer in both breasts is no different than for cancer that occurs in just one breast.	NEUTRAL
180248256	The good thing is that the tumor in your right breast is rather small and is ER/PR positive which will respond well to medication, such as Tamoxifen or other similar drugs to lower considerably the risk of recurrence.	POSITIVE
894201732	The tumor in your left breast is Grade 1 which is also a good thing.	POSITIVE
818386018	It’s going to be a long journey but don’t be disheartened.	POSITIVE

319088625	Wishing you all the best and successful outcome.	POSITIVE
1674073552	Hi, ER (Estrogen) and PR (Progesterone) receptor status tests are done to show whether or not one or both of those hormones fuel your tumor.	NEUTRAL
56016538	Estrogen positive, even if it’s weak, medication such as Tamoxifen (or other similar drugs) is usually recommended to lower the risk of recurrence in the same breast and helps prevent new cancer in the opposite breast.	NEUTRAL
2117673992	 Cancer that is hormone-sensitive is slightly slower growing and has a better chance of responding to hormone-suppression drugs, than cancer that is hormone receptor negative.	NEUTRAL
1310647909	 HER-2/neu negative cancer is also a good thing, because it is considered less aggressive than HER-2 positive.	POSITIVE
2091279072	 I am sure that your Doctors will explain all this to you in details, when you’ll meet them.	NEUTRAL
357286565	 Since you have decided on a double mastectomy, I will send you a link by PM.	NEUTRAL

369657961	Hi  I just did a follow up ultra sound, on a lump that my radiologist had been following for a year and a half.	NEUTRAL
1094484228	 My results said that it grew and changed from 5mm to 9mm diagnoses bi raids 4  so i had the biopsy doctor calls and said that tissues are benign.	NEUTRAL
699794779	  Then he proceeds to tell me that i have a intraductal papilloma 9mm.	NEUTRAL
604850318	 he then stated that i need and excisional biopsy  time to see a breast surgent,  during the conversation he stated that it is very rare that these are cancer only a 5% chance.	NEUTRAL
1008018793	  So my questions is can i leave this alone i prefer to just follow it?	NEUTRAL
1895255908	  If i left it in and it did turn to cancer what could the outcome be how dangerous could it get even if i am being followed.	NEUTRAL
1790446210	   I again would prefer to just leave it alone.	NEUTRAL
296676229	 Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
591027433	I would NOT just leave it alone and I can't imagine why anyone would choose to do this.	NEGATIVE
1092709910	5% may not seem much of a chance to you but even a 1% chance would send me to a Breast Surgeon immediately.	NEUTRAL
1569487267	You can do whatever you feel comfortable with but since there has been growth give it some more thought before you decide to ignore this condition.	NEGATIVE
536793672	Even if you do see a Breast Surgeon there is a chance that he/she may agree with waiting and doing close interval testing and the choice will still be yours and yours alone.	NEUTRAL

1066194903	 Please know that i am concerned and do not take this lightly,  but for me i have had so many scares and they have thank goodness all come back benign.	POSITIVE
2146943405	It is scary but for me i feel maybe it would just be better to follow this and see if there is a change.	NEGATIVE
1957563177	I will post more on Thursday when i have the results.	NOT_LABELED
1605129786	Regards.....	NOT_LABELED
187137335	Great to hear that you are going to keep seeking a definite answer.	POSITIVE

296676216	Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
290521272	It sounds as though you have found a GREAT Surgeon who has exactly the right information and caring that you need.	POSITIVE
355276762	The follow-up plan seems very appropriate and I would be comfortable with that myself.	POSITIVE
1660980221	I do think it wise to go ahead with the second opinion to further clear things in your mind.	POSITIVE
2137316482	The hematoma issue isn't at all unusual in such circumstances with biopsies but it can complicate the situation.	NEUTRAL
1144677266	Remember that the decision you make today or 3 months from now won't necessarily change the outcome.	NEUTRAL
1055770250	Even though papilloma can be cancer, if there is only one they are usually watched for a period of time.	NEUTRAL
893162685	You're on the right track but try not to confuse yourself by doing TOO much research as no 2 cases are the same and you can't depend too much on percentages, they are too general.	NEUTRAL
809780317	Take care and stay busy .... NO negative thinking !!	NEUTRAL
1690285322	Hi I went for my second opinion, Not sure what to make of the appointment though.	NEUTRAL
1495894517	This doctor is a top breast Sergent in my area, She actually did my first breast surgery in 2008.	POSITIVE
1120336500	  When i saw her i felt like she was a little pushy,  She said to me it grew and surgery  was the best route even though i do not have any of the symptoms and the biopsy came back benign.	NEUTRAL
1641269773	She quoted to me (Pathology report too consider excision.)	NEUTRAL
1455101857	When i ask questions i felt like she thought i was stupid and she did not want to answer questions she cut me off, proceeded to tell me two options surgery or follow every six months.	NEGATIVE
549740687	 My question which i think is important does anyone know?	NEUTRAL
806168849	Are there any studies of women who were follow with intraductal papilloma what is the long term out come.	NEUTRAL
426713677	That's too bad that you had a less than comfortable experience with the Breast Surgeon; perhaps she was having a bad day ????	NEGATIVE
514655684	At this point since the chance of a single papilloma being malignant is rather small you might as well follow it for the recommended 6 months.	NEUTRAL
214807745	This all began the last of November and you should count the 6 months from that date and see what is recommended at your next check-up which would be in the Spring.	NEUTRAL
2136290454	If at that time it is determined to be benign then it can be left alone.	NEUTRAL
888451255	On the other hand if you are "done" with all the re-checks and possible biopsies then have it removed and over with.	NEUTRAL
97086927	It all comes down to what you are comfortable with.	NEUTRAL
192197947	I would make my appointment now for the 6 month check-up if that's the way you intend to go so there will be no waiting when the time actually arrives.	NEUTRAL
1592200492	 Regards ....	NOT_LABELED
1861139192	I really don't see any difference in the two.	NEUTRAL
705877977	The area is being removed either way.	NEUTRAL
1574037539	It seems to me that this is just the use of different terminology.	NEUTRAL
52737556	 Best wishes for a speedy recovery .....	POSITIVE
2081141412	That does seem rather a long time but it depends upon exactly what your normal activity consists of, like strenuous exercise which would not be wise or several other things that would  put undue strain on muscles, etc.	NEUTRAL
595270619	I would increase your activities very gradually but NEVER go against the advice of the Surgeon.	NEUTRAL
374639454	Complete healing of the tissues does take quite some time and you certainly would not want to delay that.	NEUTRAL
1370111683	 I'm glad to hear the things went well and hope for GREAT news when the reports come in.	POSITIVE
357026958	Do take it easy though.... Regards.	NEUTRAL
1856706048	When I went in for my mammogram, I was told that my benign scattered calcifications that I had for the last 2 years were misread and are actually fine, linear calcifications, but because they were stable for 2 years they told me to come back in 6 months.	NEUTRAL
1113876556	 They gave me a BI RADS 3.	NEUTRAL
1181561008	 When I got my report, my breast density was reported as extremely dense.	NEUTRAL
247194292	 I have always had heterogeneously dense breasts.	NEUTRAL
591339982	 I have since done a lot of googling and cannot understand why they wouldn't biopsy.	NEGATIVE
1712694390	 I have found out that DCIS can be stable for a while and that the morphology is more important than the stability over time.	NEUTRAL
1506275081	 Why would they wait!	NEGATIVE
130590630	 I am so scared!	NEGATIVE
192907486	 Do they know what they are doing?	NEGATIVE
911976719	Thoughts please?	NOT_LABELED
795942794	Hi.	NEUTRAL
1728031891	 Experienced Radiologists are quite able to identify typically benign breast calcifications depending on their form and pattern.	NEUTRAL
396543077	If no suspicion is detected a biopsy is not required to prevent unnecessary procedures.	NEUTRAL
1297218234	 BIRADS Category 3, means that the findings have a very high probability of being benign, therefore  recommending a short-interval follow-up.	NEUTRAL
1548623475	I wouldn't worry so much if I were you, because what your radiologist has recommended is standard procedure.	NEUTRAL
365160667	If these calcification were suspicious in any way, I am sure a biopsy would have certainly been ordered.	NEUTRAL
1724281747	 But of course this is up to you to decide….if you still feel uncomfortable waiting six months for a follow up, you could always have your films read by another Radiologist for a second opinion, or ask your Doctor to order a biopsy.	NEUTRAL
867182691	 Best wishes...  	NOT_LABELED
246137679	Thank you for your answer.	NEUTRAL
994107068	 I don't understand why I have to have a mammogram in 6 months.	NEGATIVE
1677336066	 Why can't I just get one in 1 year?	NEUTRAL
1574494696	 I don't think BI RADS 3 is very useful to have to spend the extra money to watch something that is benign.	NEGATIVE
1681805608	 When will I ever go back to once a year mammograms?	NEUTRAL
1230290186	Hi again, You have been asked to have these calcification monitored every 6 month simply because when the radiologist assigns calcifications to a "probably benign" category, the risk of malignancy even if very low ( less than 2%) can change unexpectedly.	NEUTRAL
431371336	Typically these calcifications will be monitored every six months for at least one year.	NEUTRAL
351295205	Assuming that no new changes are found, your doctor will recommend you have a routine mammogram once a year.	NEUTRAL
171623310	I hope that you’ll follow your doctor’s recommendation to make sure there is no change in the size, shape or number of calcifications.	NEUTRAL
1678936428	My calcifications have already been stable for over 2 years.	POSITIVE
2003899890	 Can you show me any resource that says if a radiologist sees fine, linear calcifications to "wait and see" for six months?	NEUTRAL
1483380640	  If they want them stable for a year, I have been stable for more than 2 years.	POSITIVE
329263696	 I have not seen 1 resource where it is recommended that fine, linear calcifications be put in the BI RADS 3 or 2 categories.	NEUTRAL
1099817452	 My mammograms have all been the same, the only difference is that the radiologists have misread them.	NEGATIVE
2966762292	 Thank you	NOT_LABELED
1818710939	If the calcifications can change unexpectedly, then is the risk still less than 2%?	NEUTRAL
102130753	 If they haven't changed in 2 years, what is the risk they will change in 2 1/2 years, 3 years, ect...?	NEUTRAL
1501818390	I really cannot say why your Radiologist asked you to follow-up in 6 months since your calcifications have been stable for 2 years.	NEUTRAL
1372066530	Linear calcification is not always indicative of malignancy.	NEUTRAL
286367704	The suspicion is raised only when they are clustered and appear to form several branches.	NEUTRAL
1569854859	When they are linear but detached, such as probably yours are, it’s usually not worrisome but they have to be monitored regularly.	NEUTRAL
2092426263	I wish I could give you more information about the things you are requesting here, but the only advice I can give you is to have your Mammogram films read by a different Radiologist for a second opinion and also to have your test report explained to you in details by your Doctor who is your best source of information.	NEUTRAL
2140302557	I wish you well...  	NOT_LABELED
1867518096	Thank you zouzi for the information.	NOT_LABELED
1529609706	 I don't understand if they are not worrisome, why watch them?	NEUTRAL
1980048256	 It seems like a waste of resources.	NEGATIVE
1716923313	 What benign condition is linear but detached calcifications?	NEUTRAL
695798262	It appears from the many posts on this forum regarding incisions opening after lumpectomies that it must be pretty common.	NEUTRAL
301594413	 I had a lumpectomy on March 12.	NEUTRAL
1099188297	 Two weeks later, it opened overnight.	NEGATIVE
1718632296	 In the morn it was oozing & bleeding.	NEGATIVE
1601156060	 I returned to the surgeon, who said it was infected.	NEGATIVE
288128148	 I was given antibiotics.	NEUTRAL
1750831443	 My oncologist looked at it a week later and said it was no longer infected, but to return to the surgeon if it looked like it wasn't healing.	NEUTRAL
1624972942	 Part of the incision is slowly healing, but a new section opened and is bleeding slightly.	NEUTRAL
596685493	 I keep it covered with gauze to keep it clean.	NEUTRAL
77860423	 How long shoud I give this to heal?	NEUTRAL
253848826	 I didn't expect this to happen at all with the healing of the incision.	NEUTRAL
328647200	 My surgeon did not seem concerned.	POSITIVE
577982755	 He surely sees it all the time.	NEUTRAL
1700127094	 It's good to be reassured.	POSITIVE
629089878	 I am so glad to have this site with all who care so much about one another.	POSITIVE

2117455694	 It's small and bleeding just a little.	NEUTRAL
687646330	 I'll give it some more time.	NEUTRAL
1257111547	 Thank you again and I hope everything is ok with you now.	POSITIVE
1828899364	I didn't either.	NOT_LABELED
1236303866	 Personally I didn't expect to get an infection and definitely didn't anticipate needing district nursing input.	NEGATIVE
1443703862	Perhaps I took recovery for granted as I healed really well, and quickly, after having a duct out during a previous operation.	NEUTRAL
800520470	It is good if a surgeon doesn't seem concerned -I think.	POSITIVE
1978660194	Bleeding is a good sign as it denotes healthy tissue.	POSITIVE
1438349473	 Too much bleeding is not though.	NEGATIVE
1625119573	I've really benefited from this site and the support, advice and information too.	POSITIVE
282012432	 It's been invaluable.	POSITIVE
1381856024	I expect that section too will heal.	POSITIVE
384393901	 I think it's normal for us to become anxious, etc during our recoveries.	NEUTRAL
480707123	 This is all new to us and we're learning about ourselves and our bodies during this process.	NEUTRAL
1326558710	I had stitches poke through my skin too.	NEUTRAL
1068673054	 Just when I thought I'd healed I found this thing on my breast.	NEUTRAL
368972932	 I was scared it had become infected again but it was only a mushy little stitch which I pulled out myself.	NEUTRAL
898638523	 (The stitch was redundant anyhow as the surgical registrar had cut it to insert a drain for the infection).	NEUTRAL
2016899921	You're welcome.	NOT_LABELED

1378388681	 My question is, does it hurt to have packing.	NEUTRAL
1633772740	 I have never had it before and am a little overwhelmed	NEGATIVE
936023860	This is a very old thread.	NEUTRAL
623550510	I would suggest you start your own new  thread.	NEUTRAL
755177697	If you describe the details of your situation and ask your questions there, you will be more likely to get answers addressed specifically to you and your concerns.	NEUTRAL
219896547	Best wishes	NOT_LABELED
1872969565	Radiation does delay healing so that's why you are being delayed for that part of your treatment.	NEUTRAL
538952223	As far as the packing is concerned, if the area isn't painful at the present then I doubt that it will be terribly uncomfortable.	POSITIVE
1562509636	I have had a couple of areas that required packing and I had no pain but it was not in the same area as yours.	NEUTRAL
859134688	The amount of discomfort with the packing and removing it daily would also depend on the depth of the wound.	NEUTRAL
247629535	 Here's hoping it will be effective and not cause you very much discomfort.	NEUTRAL

125054595	The tumors were removed, my margins came back clear.	POSITIVE
836067605	I don't want to go through chemotherapy, I am willing to do radiation along with hepercin  will this  help me at all?	NEUTRAL
1863446660	I think what the doctor is trying to tell you is that surgery in your case is necessary, and which you now say you had.	NEUTRAL
2004562029	He also said that especially if lymph nodes are involved, chemotherapy is highly recommended and the right way to go in your case.	NEUTRAL
1961621684	It will not guarantee that you will live forever but it will increase your chances of living longer.	POSITIVE
37032338	I do understand what you are saying, after all mt tests from the muga scan to the mri bone scat and cat scan.	NEUTRAL
481548035	Blood work and so on, after all the tests came back would the doctors know if the cance has spresd to other area outside of my lymph nodes?	NEUTRAL
72493	Hi.	NOT_LABELED
103258448	 If the cancer has been found in the lymph nodes, there is a significant probability that there is already microscopic spread to other areas of the body.	NEUTRAL
595987251	 This microscopic spread may not be easily detected by conventional imaging procedures.	NEGATIVE
669179545	 So even if the initial tests were negative for distant metastases, if the lymph nodes are already involved, it is imperative to do some additional treatment like chemotherapy, since we are not sure that the negative results are totally reliable.	NEUTRAL
1176941028	Is there a time lime to have chemotherapy?,	NEUTRAL
581871935	right now I am unable to have the chemotherapy due to financial reason.	NEGATIVE
1720485447	I am not counting it out all together maybe sometime next year?	NEUTRAL
2016512704	This is what I have been told.	NEUTRAL
1934410799	When you are first diagnosed, a team of doctors set up your treatment plan. (	NEUTRAL
1154697713	or a doctor/doctors talk about what they think is the best thing to do in any particular case for the best possible outcome and prevention of reoccurrence.)	NEUTRAL
138194740	Then , if the patient agrees to this, you go ahead with it.	NEUTRAL
1201545935	If you do, then the initial treatments are really the most important of all the treatment, as the goal is to wipe out whatever cancer there is and may be lurking the very first time.	NEUTRAL
1597602703	If you decide to do chemo a year or so later, this will no longer be part of the initially recommended treatment that according to the doctor's best judgement has the highest chance of working in your best interest.	NEGATIVE
1893726723	Radiation will certainly help with reoccurrence, and it will attack whatever may have spread outside of the surgical area that was removed.	POSITIVE
1925896154	But as the doctor above explains, with positive lymph nodes there is a chance that the cancer has spread, and in half of the cases those lesions are so tiny that they won't show up on a bone scan or other test.	NEUTRAL
44162754	So, this is why chemotherapy is utilized to make sure that if this spread is there it is wiped out by chemo immediately, because after the first chance the cancer will only spread and grow. (	NEUTRAL
1432263948	I mean even with radiation, it will grow outside of the radiation area.)	NEGATIVE
154584627	Radiation is local treatment just like surgery, and chemo is systemic.	NEUTRAL
1690568799	So is tamoxifen but  it's not indicated in your case.	NEUTRAL
28363907	Do not put off chemo because of financial reasons.	NEUTRAL
225524585	There are breast cancer advocate organizations that can help you get treatment.	POSITIVE
177959985	I think one of them is called youcanthrive.org, or something close to that.	NEUTRAL
185245756	Find an advocate and get the treatment you need.	NEUTRAL
664344341	Your LIFE is more important than financial considerations.	NEUTRAL
768772863	NOBODY in this country should have to risk recurrence of a life threatening disease because they can't afford treatment.	NEGATIVE
813046622	I had Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in 09.	NEGATIVE
433206050	Treatment included 2 lumpectomies, chemotherapy and radiation.	NEUTRAL
2085510238	When cancer reaches your lymph nodes, you have no idea where the cancer cells have traveled through your body, therefore chemotherapy treatment is necessary.	NEUTRAL
765918576	Do you know of any more of the advocate and financial support groups?	NEUTRAL

1408161443	The lymph node involvement is the problem to be addressed first.	NEGATIVE
196054867	I truly hope that you are being treated by an Oncologist and that she will not refuse whatever treatment that is recommended.	NEUTRAL
1385510409	The only proven treatment for cancer at any stage is a combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and possible Hormone Therapy following the appropriate surgery at the time the cancer is first discovered.	NEUTRAL
1407088066	As far as prognosis at this point; that would be something you should discuss with your Mother's Oncologist as he/she has all the necessary information regarding the cancer.	NEUTRAL

1788922570	So sorry to learn of your mother's health.... The first doctor apparently did not do his job aty all.	NEGATIVE
1928664350	 By all means, seek the assistance of a good oncologist -- but listen to his/her recommendations.	NEUTRAL
907659569	 They will almost always without a doubt recommend the chemotherapy protocol, which has NOT been proven to help the majority of those receiving it (less than 15%).	NEGATIVE
560199523	 Remember one thing -- and that is an oncologist job is to educate and inform patients only of what they are taught and told to relate to patients.	NEUTRAL

1381760063	 I am in a similar position having been recently diagnosed with metastases to the bones.	NEGATIVE
1480289459	 From what I understand this means that the cancer is in stage IV.	NEUTRAL

106241957	 My doctor said that she has seen a few patients live for 10 years in this condition.	NEUTRAL
1605567116	 The danger is that the cancer will move to vital organs.	NEUTRAL
795795600	 If you look on the computer the statistics for life with metastatic cancer are grim (2-3yrs)  I have been assured that life expectancy can be much longer if the cancer can be stabilized.	POSITIVE
