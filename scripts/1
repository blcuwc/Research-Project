I have been a coffee drinker on and off since I was little.  I notice now that I am older, and perhaps I have always had this issue just did not correlate the connection between the two, but I have to wonder if it is possible for me to have an allergy to coffee.
When I drink it, if I drink about 2 cups a day spaced out, it takes about a week for me to get these symptoms:
- sore throat
- increased nasal drainage and nasal drip in the back of my throat
- sometimes slight eye swelling
- slight cough
I always kind of said oh it's just allergies from pollen or I am catching a cold... but in fact when I do not consume coffee, I am back to normal in about 3 days.  I tried to find some information on this but it seems hard to read up on.
Would be great if anyone had any feedback on this.  Thanks so much.
