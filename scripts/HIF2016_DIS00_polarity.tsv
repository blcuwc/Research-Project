2078831917	 When I saw that this happens even with the cat, I knew that what I had read about craving things one is allergic to is true and it can't be just psychological.	NEUTRAL
2015366979	 Cats are obligate carnivores after all.	NEUTRAL
2104219107	 There is likely a psychological connection, but it seems that there must be a physical connection, too, since the cat does this somewhat if something is really rich, like muffins, which I haven't had in forever since I haven't figured out how to make gluten free.	NEUTRAL

1054355901	 I don't understand why doctors assume that a skin allergy to metals isn't serious enough to consider that taking the stuff internally would still be bad.	NEGATIVE
299190381	 I mean, the whole reason the skin scratch tests work as tests is because the skin is reacting to something the whole body is allergic to.	NEUTRAL

1781146200	There is very little online about the type of coffee allergy I've been experiencing but in doing some initial research, it looks like this is developing over time and perhaps its not an actual caffeine allergy as it is something to do with the coffee or it's processing methods.	NEUTRAL

298779766	Hello everyone, I am a 40 y. o. musician and I enjoy a healthy lifestyle ( balanced diet + daily exercise).	NEUTRAL
95066028	My health is good except for a recently diagnosed intolerance to Tyramine.	NEUTRAL
984919524	For ex.	NEGATIVE
2116216942	if i eat a few slices of salami on an empty stomach it will trigger an attack, which is always the same : i get a really fast heartbeat + increased blood pressure + nausea 15 mn after ingestion.	NEGATIVE
2222216942	Sometimes the heart palpitations last for 1/2 h ( 120-130 bpm), and the nausea + lightheadedness will last for a day, it depends on the type of food, if i am tired etc... I am 99% sure the culprit is Tyramine, which is a natural amine found in all foods but much higher in foods that are aged, fermented, pickled  ( salami, cheese, sauerkraut, smoked salmon, anchovy paste ), in foods that have been stored for a long time ( nuts, dried fruits) and also in overripe fruits like bananas, oranges and avocados.	NEUTRAL
493943550	 The list of foods I was reacting to was so eclectic, I couldn’t find the link between them for a long time, it was very perplexing and scary and i lost a lot of weight.	NEGATIVE

1394439517	Later I found a list of Tyramine loaded foods in which I recognized every single food that had triggered an attack after I ingested it.	NEUTRAL
1196337335	There is no test to confirm my theory but since I eliminated these Tyramine loaded foods from my diet I feel much better and less terrified of eating, and I am even putting some weight back on ( 112 lbs for 5’4”).	POSITIVE
1316289586	 Soon hopefully I will feel strong enough to start reintroducing these foods into my diet in very small quantities to get myself desensitized, unless of course one day I wake up free of this strange condition that appeared for no reason and might disappear the same way.	POSITIVE
934620636	 I guess what is very puzzling to me is the fact that this sensitivity appeared out of the blue, that the symptoms are so violent and that I DO NOT get migraines.	NEUTRAL
1042235727	People who have problems with foods high in Tyramine usually are either migraine sufferers and/or on antidepressant ( MAOs).	NEUTRAL
76385122	I do not take any medication and my symptoms are always exactly the same 5 to 10 mn after ingesting the culprit food : tachycardia + hypertension + tremors + nausea and sometimes light headache when the attack is really bad.	NEGATIVE
1760648899	After having had about 14 attacks within the last 12 months it is such a relief to be able to eat again !	POSITIVE
1390014018	 So I guess now my goal is to put the word out and ask as many persons as possible is they have ever heard of a patient with the same symptoms, which is why I posted this text.	NEUTRAL
1089067941	 Does anyone have the same symptoms or know anything about Tyramine ?	NEUTRAL
1627066056	I think tyramine effects glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity.	NEUTRAL
1284679874	The heart reacts to changes in insulin levels, which can cause the palpitations.	NEUTRAL
1518247415	 Perhaps you are becoming more insulin sensitive, for some reason?	NEUTRAL
1007291175	Congratulations on finding the culprit causing your symptoms!	POSITIVE
1731111567	Great sleuthing!	POSITIVE

241855766	 She eats meat, but there are a lot of things that include cooking with sesame that give her an allergic reaction right away.	NEGATIVE

1537179845	 One brand of a fruit is ok but another one will cause severe allergic reactions.	NEGATIVE
1427231631	 Organic apples usually are okay, and all others are not which makes us really wonder about pesticides in her case.	NEUTRAL
1476378624	When you mention the bag of antibiotics, this is a long shot -- but, can you find the manufacturer of the two bags and see if one contained latex and the other did not?	NEUTRAL

206364252	 She, also was severe intolerant to almost 20 foods.	NEUTRAL

754364795	This is one reason they are so difficult to diagnose.	NEGATIVE
843757700	 Heartburn and GI disturbances are definite ramifications of food allergies by the way.	NEUTRAL
1952421565	Some of the foods that trigger my reactions are wheat, whey, eggs, the list is long, but these are the more common ones.	NEGATIVE
1655455253	I have never had an anaphylatic shock from any, the the good Lord, but, sure have had other symptoms that make a person miserable.	NEGATIVE

400847809	 And now I am definitely looking more into this as a solution for my husband.	NEUTRAL

995980230	I'm going to have to start keeping a food journal of trigger foods.	NEUTRAL

1393649241	And what is interesting is this can go beyond normal foods--- I got heartburn the other day from chewing a gum that had aspartame in it, that was awful!	NEGATIVE
839977884	 I usually never chew gum with the aspartame in it or phenyltronics ( not sure of spelling) and I did because I was desperate and it was horrible.	NEGATIVE
1818167665	 Also had this happen several times with toothpaste.	NEUTRAL

957608464	 The original one had latex in it as an aid for it to be "gum" !	NEUTRAL

724810112	 There are quite a few articles on Mercola's site about artficial sweeteners, too.	NEUTRAL

1734261654	 I had to take prescription strength Benadryl this morning because of some delayed reaction to something that was making it impossible to sleep because of the reflux.	NEGATIVE
552835479	 Conventional medicine would write this off and say that GERD is simply the over production of stomach acid.	NEUTRAL
684863962	 Well, actually, that's over-simplifying GERD.	NEGATIVE
1250841383	 I took the Benadryl, because it's better than reaching for the PPI meds that shut off the stomach acid and are so bad for a person's health when used long-term.	NEUTRAL
1598362826	 They actually cause the stomach to start churning out even more acid in the long run, too, because the stomach will notice the missing acid and over compensate.	NEUTRAL
1702717236	  I actually have quite a long list of foods that do this to me.	NEUTRAL
1654634520	 The majority of my food sensitivities cause this reaction.	NEGATIVE

1086736705	 It's the gluten in traditional breads that keeps this from happening.	NEUTRAL

584741316	 Actually, I did a bit of research on some modern day ingredients of these gums and found out that many do still use a form of latex.	NEUTRAL
1875851171	 It just isn't called "latex" after the alterations the scientists have done with it.	NEUTRAL
961272498	 I used to chew gum as a kid, but now it all bothers me.	NEGATIVE
229946633	 I don't think it's just one ingredient that bothers me.	NEGATIVE

2122474494	 Mercola explained something interesting about chewing gum that I had no idea about when I was a a kid.	NEUTRAL
475300094	 He said that chewing gum can actually cause an acceleration of the decrease in digestive enzymes that all people get as we age.	NEGATIVE
190479365	 So, this decrease happens at a much faster rate when people chew a lot of gum than if they don't.	NEGATIVE
28997300	 None of us knew that back when I was a kid who chewed gum.	NEGATIVE
477903464	I had no idea about the latex :(  I love Dr. Mercola site and the free newsletter that they send out, it's very helpful.	POSITIVE

266386942	I'm not, doc thinks it  may be thrush mouth due to antibiotics, been on Clotrimazole 10 mg Troche for fourth day, no change tho.	NEGATIVE
140577440	Not sure what's happening.	NEUTRAL
1833470795	I thought I'd kick off a very short post about latex allergies.	NEUTRAL
1483500669	 It is becoming increasingly common, and one way we screen people for potential latex allergies in the hospital is by asking about food allergies.	NEUTRAL
331787583	 Because some proteins in rubber are similar to food proteins, some foods may cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to latex.	NEUTRAL
1628789984	The most common of these foods are banana, avocado, chestnut, kiwi fruit and passion fruit.	NEUTRAL
724357008	 If you've ever eaten these foods, and have a funny "tingly" feeling in your mouth, or rash around your mouth after eating them, mention this to your doctor the next time you go.	NEUTRAL
1697004460	 You may be latex-sensitive.	NEUTRAL
808392665	Peek, are you okay with contact latex from glove exposure through the years?	NEUTRAL
1325169983	Here is a good website on Cross Reactions (Latex - Food) I have in my bookmarks.	POSITIVE
975198960	Allergic Cross Reactions - Latex, Fruit, Nuts, Pollen, other -- Good information with % of possible incidence.	POSITIVE
1116105435	 http://www.allergyclinic.co.nz/guides/42.html It wasn't until my daughter had an anaphylactic reaction from a plum (out of the blue) that her kean allergist suggested a blood test for Latex and it was very positive.	NOT_LABELED
1198470486	Latex and foods .. people rarely connect the two!	NEUTRAL
908787970	C~  	NEUTRAL
691708786	Believe it or not, I've not had any problem with latex allergies, despite over 30 years of constant exposure.	POSITIVE
1079509019	 And I'm a fairly allergic person, with asthma, many drug allergies, cat allergies...just not latex.	NEGATIVE
289790400	I've seen many of my coworkers develop it, though.	NEGATIVE
490418070	 Most of our gloves and supplies are latex free, now.	POSITIVE
886768961	I find that to be very interesting.	POSITIVE
1320737345	I didn't know there was a correlation between the proteins.	NEUTRAL
132506093	My daughter is allergic to latex, banana, kiwi, and avocado.	NEGATIVE
1212589610	She carries an epi pin due to the avocado allergy.	NEUTRAL
460824215	My daughter is married and on her own now.	NEUTRAL
902615733	 She found out the hard way about the latex allergy.	NEGATIVE
918328502	Let's just say her first experience with a condom was a nightmare!	NEGATIVE
2342437	LOL	NOT_LABELED
117475253	Oh, my.	NOT_LABELED
2035914120	 Yes, a condom "incident" can be awful.	NEGATIVE
153773573	I have a long list of food intolerances--grains, diary, sesame, soy--and have reacted to band-aids and the latex in the collars and cuffs of turtlenecks and socks, so I'm pretty sure I have a latex sensitivity--I make it part of my medical record to be on the safe side.	NEGATIVE
1591321475	A couple of years ago I was began getting reactions to fresh fruits--first signs of mouth swelling, rashes.	NEGATIVE
1686363641	I was really bummed that I was losing another huge food group.	NEGATIVE
1516281930	Then I read somewhere that birch was a stong cross-reactor with latex and stone fruits, and realized the Tom's toothpaste I used three times a day was sweetened with xylitol made from birch bark.	NEUTRAL
1358884802	Apparently xylitol also occurs in fruits (raspberries and plums are mentioned most often), mushrooms, and corn.	NEUTRAL
1427023148	Maybe it was a coincidence, but I quit using the toothpaste and my reactions to fruit have mostly stopped, though I have to be careful not to eat too many raspberries.	POSITIVE
1586423257	I can relate to the food sensitivities issue all too well myself.	POSITIVE
1585558423	 It can get really frustrating to deal with some days.	NEGATIVE
341599240	 Everything you said about stone fruits is what I was told one time in the hospital, too.	NEUTRAL
1092303454	 I didn't know that it was xylitol that made raspberries a problem food for me, but now I know why they bother me.	NEGATIVE
588971144	 I used to love going to my grandparent's house and pick the fresh raspberries off of the vine, too.	POSITIVE
2030939948	 I definitely have the latex sensitivity myself, because it will definitely burn my skin.	NEGATIVE
847658559	 I know about some of the cross reactions.	NEUTRAL
1326845909	 You're right about it being a huge food group.	NEUTRAL
1648300191	 All because of birch!	NEGATIVE
937833505	 I make it a point to tell my doctors that I'm allergic to latex and band-aids every time they draw blood, too, because the lab techs don't always read the allergy bands that the hospital puts on my wrists.	NEGATIVE
152927186	 I still have to remind my primary care doctor about this one.	NEGATIVE
642286183	One that isn't always mentioned, but is still actually a stone fruit is avacado.	NEUTRAL
27613272	 I was also told that bananas have the same protein in them as latex.	NEUTRAL
1296277875	 They're also "binding" for me.	NEGATIVE
856517981	 I didn't know mushrooms were in this category, I just knew I couldn't eat them either.	NEUTRAL
476635087	 You're right, this pretty much wipes out the fruit category.	NEGATIVE
1128480764	Do you also have problems with mints and other herbs?	NEUTRAL
88545551	 I noticed that you already mentioned cinnamon.	NEUTRAL
1446507977	All peanuts and tree nuts are out for me, too.	NEUTRAL
801299421	 And, anything in the sunflower family, which is another huge family.	NEUTRAL
135619142	 If you're allergic to sunflower oil and seeds, steer clear of calendula oil.	NEUTRAL
1180594086	 Calendula is a very close cousin to marigolds.	NEUTRAL
867958167	 I found out the hard way that they're also in the sunflower family.	NEGATIVE
739684246	 Here's one I bet you didn't know:  Lettuce, spinach and dandelions are all in the sunflower family, too.	NEUTRAL
895824953	 Well, that explains why I'll get nauseous and throw up if I try to eat the stuff.	NEGATIVE
366958709	I can't remember which forum I read, but I have found out that this huge laundry list of food sensitivities that is caused by the cross-reactions to birch is called Oral Allergy Syndrome.	NEUTRAL
566530641	 I know about the mouth blisters inside of the mouth only all too well.	NEGATIVE
885619074	 I've always had some of these blisters from certain foods and substances, but I've noticed that some things are worse than others.	NEGATIVE
56876281	 Citrus is one of the worst ones as far as the blisters inside of the mouth.	NEGATIVE
216371432	 My lips don't like citrus either.	NEGATIVE
796668396	 I'll bet most of our food sensitivities are exactly the same because of that definite allergy to birch.	NEUTRAL
1432679927	It's funny how the food sensitivities tests all have come back negative, even though I know I have bad reactions to these foods and will be sick.	NEGATIVE
1289945988	 But, I'm definitely allergic to birch, as in true allergy.	NEUTRAL
498717933	 So, that explains the laundry list of food sensitivities and the latex and band-aid sensitivities.	NEUTRAL
344666658	Thanks for the link to the allergy cross reactions page.	POSITIVE
987081024	 I bookmarked this page for myself, too.	NEUTRAL
1718822091	 And, I'll pass on this link to a good friend of mine who has the same problem that we both obviously share here.	NEUTRAL
1804066382	WOW .. I have to say I've learned a lot from these posts and have been dealing with latex allergy for 8 yrs now!	POSITIVE
1822897090	 The Xylitol is new to me and I will mention it to my daughter to be careful for that ingredient.	NEUTRAL
639395559	 She is super allergic to birch pollen and mugwort which is a weed that cross reacts with raw carrots .. she gets huge swelling inside her mouth in the OAS you describe above.	NEGATIVE
950604551	 There is a small % of OAS that can migrate into Anaphylaxis so avoidance is key.	NEGATIVE
570453438	C~	NEUTRAL
1958710992	Hehehe.... My first experience with err latex was errr very embarrassing.	NEGATIVE
1829346094	I've been telling people about the Latex-avocado cross allergy for a while.	NEUTRAL
1230129427	I'm a nerd, and typed all the things that bug me in the search on Google a couple years ago, and found out about it.	NEUTRAL
1700294418	I have a very mild reaction to latex, however my reaction to banana's and avocados is increasingly getting worse.	NEGATIVE
37893369	My biggest fear is I'm pre-med, and allergic to latex.	NEGATIVE
1348260492	I really really hope this will not affect my career!	NEGATIVE
1983179387	You may want to have him tested (via blood) to know .. because repeated expsosure must be limited or else it can get worse.	NEUTRAL
21822081	 Glad the dentist uses non-latex gloves, but with his history,it's probably best to know for sureC~	POSITIVE
1055979405	Well everyone can't believe I am posting this, after 36 years and literally probably 25 years of eating shrimp I had my first reaction to it 3 days ago.	NEGATIVE
1393024063	 All I had was cocktail shrimp and cocktail sauce.	NEUTRAL
1250140934	 The same sauce I used last week.	NEUTRAL
729208689	 This time I just ate more shrimp then I normally do.	NEUTRAL
1719360905	 I had no sides or anything with the shrimp just cocktail shrimp.	NEUTRAL
431421872	 And literally 2 hours later I broke out in welts on my thighs and my upper arms.	NEGATIVE
1435931930	 My throat started getting swollen but luckily not to the point where I couldn't breath.	NEGATIVE
771840603	 I took Benadryl that night and it helped with the rash but the symptoms have literally lasted about 3 days now.	POSITIVE
602890240	 I have spoke to some people about this that have allergies and they have mentioned that I will now have to be concerned with Iodine.	NEUTRAL
94744204	 I remember when I got a cat scan back when I was like 18 or so they asked me if I was allergic to eggs before they injected the iodine.	NEUTRAL
1037044296	 So should I also be concerned about my egg intake too?	NEUTRAL
771967398	How long can the rebound reaction last?	NEUTRAL
368291407	 Forgot to ask that lol	NEUTRAL
1342377961	I can't answer that last question, but I do know this one for sure:  Cross reactions must be taken seriously now.	NEGATIVE
1139540056	 So, no lobster and no crabs either.	NEUTRAL
1858569780	 And, since krill are also a related crustacean, you won't want to supplement with krill oil either, even though it's supposed to be superior to fish oil in the way of animal based omega 3 fatty acids.	NEGATIVE
2056145496	I don't have a true allergy to crustaceans, yet, but I watch it, since I've had a globus-like reaction the last few times I ate shrimp.	NEGATIVE
120639784	 Now, I'm scared to eat crustaceans myself.	NEGATIVE
1533880875	 It's more of a food sensitivity, which is why I'm aware of the cross reactions.	NEGATIVE
1684945	 It's all the more important for you with a true allergy.	NEUTRAL
152268655	I would continue to take the Benadryl every 6 hours or so until you reach a point of real relief.	NEUTRAL
1638932654	 I believe ChitChatNine said about three days.	NEUTRAL
1682747464	 So, clearly, you're out of the woods, so to speak, but I would keep taking the Benadryl for a couple more days.	NEUTRAL
104888533	 I know there is a consulting nurse line in Seattle that you can call, too, for answers.	NEUTRAL
650514535	 There is a 24 hour number that your doctor's office should have given you for urgent care when you need to speak with a consulting nurse.	NEUTRAL
1775365146	 If not, you can call the 24 hour line connected with Harbor View.	NEUTRAL
18278634	 You can find the number on this page:  http://www.scn.org/crisis/medical.html  During the day time, you can also call 211 for the community information line.	NEUTRAL
1348102938	Don't panic that you see the word "crisis" in the address.	NEUTRAL
1220278406	 It's a general information page for the Seattle area.	NEUTRAL
76922573	 It even has the number for Bastyr.	NEUTRAL
1986615645	Furball thank you that was perfect information!	POSITIVE
1932033733	 My hives have cleared up this week, but yes I am staying away from all shellfish.	POSITIVE
636789931	 My husband had shrimp last night but I did not touch it or even handle the shells for that matter.	NEUTRAL
1014035342	Good point on the Krill Oil I would have never thought about that also being included in the list.	POSITIVE
150110525	 I am definitely glad there are so many resources here in the Seattle area.	POSITIVE
742523898	Thanks Paderla for the comment, I definitely think that I need to look into some of these reactions after my pregnancy.	NEUTRAL
672216460	 Right now I would be afraid to have any allergy testing performed in case there was something I had a severe reaction to.	NEGATIVE
1688051924	 But yes keeping a food diary I think is the safest bet.	POSITIVE
814174208	Very interesting follow up thank you!	POSITIVE
495818106	 I have been reading more and more into my allergies to get a better understanding of them so this certainly helps :D	POSITIVE
