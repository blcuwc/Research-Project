201620761	Hi Guys, I see this is a really old thread, but I want to share the info I have on this matter as it 's a top very close to my heart and I want to help anyone I can who is also struggling with these health issues... I have struggled with IBS-C since I was a little girl, and contracted HSV2 about 5 years ago.	FACT
1385943785	I have dealt with weekly, if not daily, herpes outbreaks since my contracting it.	EXPERIENCE
651535673	I found when my gut acted up (pain, distention, bloating, constipation etc), I would get an outbreak within hours.	EXPERIENCE
1892692804	Even taking Valtex at 1G per day didn't stop it.	EXPERIENCE
1958301215	I work out regularly, eat a whole foods diet and have seen a therapist regularly to manage stress.	EXPERIENCE
863359572	Nothing helped, if anything it got worse over the years.	EXPERIENCE
1007656632	 I have only recently, in the past year, found out that the underlying cause of IBS is often a condition called SIBO (small intestinal bacteria overgrowth).	EXPERIENCE
82026770	This is when bacteria that is only meant to be in the large intestine makes its way up in to the small intestine.	EXPERIENCE
1878519193	This can cause damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine as well as create gas, blasting, constipation, diarrhea, food intolerances, chronic fatigue etc.	FACT
2015805245	The reason this happens is due to low stomach acid, pancreatic exocrine function, and/or malfunctioning ileocecal valve.	FACT
1356308273	Bascially stress from emotions, food, drugs (recreational or pharma) all contribute to this problem.	FACT
1005318889	The overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to a lot of endotoxins (waste) from the bacteria.	FACT
1381772350	This waste damages the nerves surrounding in the gut leading to issues with motility (constipation, diarrhea), and weakens the immune system.	FACT
21146819	This is what lead to an opportunity for the herpes virus to express itself in me regularly.	EXPERIENCE
1260894590	It took me years to find this out.	EXPERIENCE
1875256554	I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I don't.	OPINION
921888403	To heal SIBO, you need to have a doctor or nutritionist supervise and provide a healing protocol via a diet called 'Low FODMAP", and one, to several rounds of either pharmaceutical or herbal antibiotics to rebalance the microbiome.	FACT
349192635	The low FODMAP's diet will reduce inflammation and help to starve the bacteria.	FACT
8812297	Most find a huge relief in symptoms from cutting out high FODMAP foods alone, but that's only half the battle.	FACT
208861273	You need the anti-microbials and re-inocculation.	FACT
100957967	Testing for SIBO is key.	OPINION
2105097553	You can do so through a Naturopath or Nutritionist.	FACT
651674643	It's important to know you have it for sure.	OPINION
333258454	Keep in mind, studies are now proving that SIBO is the underlying case of IBS, and can be cured with patience and diligence.	FACT
364612573	 So, the link between IBS and herpes is real.	FACT
570556406	IBS/SIBO severely weakens the immune system and creates the space of the virus to wreak havoc.	FACT
1468359625	When you get the gut micrbiome under control, the virus will not have the same opportunities to express itself.	FACT
797334711	 I really hope this helps many of you struggling with this.	OPINION
242465269	I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this I'd say; please take self-judgement out of the mix.	OPINION

484533352	I take other meds for breast cancer and osteopenia).	EXPERIENCE

2006089110	I changed my meds from salfa to mesaline and that made a 10% difference, certainly not signifant but enough to offer a little relief.	EXPERIENCE
1089851619	I have not found a solution to preventing something like this, and again being honest its something that I have almost gotten used to, its not something that I like to have to go through every morning, nor is it nice for my partner to listen to, but I certainly am getting used to it, and not eating before makes it a little easier, if i was to have breakfast then be sick, i would not be able to handle it, so I normally don't eat breakfast.
