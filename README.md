Title: Analyzing sentiment of medical social media with state-of-the-art pre-trained language models

Abstract: Sentiment analysis of medical social media has been widely explored by statistical machine learning methods, but still exists considerable space for improvement. In this research project, we applied state-of-the-art pre-trained language models BERT and XLNet to address polarity and factuality classification tasks in medical social media. The classification results show using pre-trained language models could outperform previous machine learning methods applied in the same health-related datasets (Carrillo- de Albornoz et al., 2018). In comparison between XLNet accuracy and BERT accuracy, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that 
there is no significant difference between XLNet and BERT. Through error analysis of the misclassified examples in both polarity and factuality classification of
medical social media posts, we found that neutral facts and opinions are more easily to be misclassified as negative expe- riences, comparing to other labels.
