Hi, Iam 34years old & my sonography says Solid cystic complex cyst noted in 6 o clock position in retroareolar region in left breast measuring 19*18mm & left axillary lymphadenopathy.	EXPERIENCE
what does it means?	FACT
doctor advised to go for FNAC for further evaluation but i did not get it done so far because iam scared with needles ,	EXPERIENCE
is anything serious please tell me iam very much worried.	OPINION
thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex.	FACT
Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy; they do not need to be aspirated unless they are too large and causing discomfort.	FACT
However a complex cyst is more concerning because it will on occasion be an intracystic cancer.	FACT
These type of cysts are also fluid filled sacs but contain a good percentage of solid elements, like old blood or debris.	FACT
Usually complex cysts are aspirated and the cells examined under the microscope to better evaluate their nature and to rule out cancer.	FACT
A fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure and you should not be scared because the site to be biopsied will be numbed with a local anesthetic.	FACT
Please take my advice and call your Doctor to reschedule the FNA biopsy as soon as possible so you can have peace of mind.	OPINION
Believe me, knowing what is going on is much better than not knowing and worrying about it needlessly.	OPINION
Best wishes..	NOT_LABELED

Hi, i did not do FNAC still because as i told you am scared of needles.... nw i do not feel any lump & pain is it still must for fnac???	EXPERIENCE
please lemme know as am very much worried ...	OPINION
sometimes am having mild pain on & off, as if someone is pinching is it anything serious?	EXPERIENCE
kindly advice..	NOT_LABELED
If you are not willing to follow your Doctors advice regarding the necessary testing we cannot offer any further help or advice for you here.	OPINION
Best wishes and we truly hope that your issue is not a serious one.....	NOT_LABELED
Hi, thanks for quick reply.... i understand what you say & will follow it.... I just want to know is it still compulsory for fnac because now i do not have any lumps & painï¿½	EXPERIENCE
Unless you have had another Ultrasound test there is no way for you to know whether you have the same lump or not.	OPINION
Obviously you are still not willing to do as your Doctors have advised since you seem to be coming up with any excuse not to have the recommended biopsy.	OPINION

Hi...yesterday i went for another ultrasound test & my report says: A well defined solid cystic complex lesion noted in the 6of the clock position of left breast measuring 15*12mm.	EXPERIENCE
Evidence of multiple, well defined, anechoic cystic changes noted in left areolar regions.	EXPERIENCE
Few subcentimeter lymph nodes noted in left axilla with preserved hilum, largest measuring 16*10mm.	EXPERIENCE
ADVICE: FNAC for further evaluation.	EXPERIENCE
Is it anything serious??	FACT
do you think FNAC is must because i do not feel any lump from outside.	OPINION
if it is serious & must then i will get it done ASAP..	NOT_LABELED
Kindly suggest me.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Not all breast lumps are palpable, but they can certainly be seen when you have an Ultrasound test.	FACT
Japdip has already advised you that if your Radiologist recommended a biopsy, you should, by all means, follow his/her advice as soon as possible to make sure that there is nothing serious.	OPINION
Believe me that you will feel much better knowing what this lump represents than not knowing.	OPINION
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
Thanks for your reply Zouzi ...	NOT_LABELED
Will get FNAC soon.	EXPERIENCE
I have a question how likely is it that i have breast cancer??	FACT
should i be worried??	FACT
what does my report suggest??	FACT
... .i have checked with 5 doctors and out of 5 doctors 4 suggested me to go for FNAC as soon as possible & 1doctor told me today that I can still wait for some time....	EXPERIENCE
iam really confused with my case so kindly give your opinion.	EXPERIENCE
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Not even a Radiologist can tell you anything for sure until you have the biopsy and the cells examined by a Pathologist.	FACT
This lump could be anything and not necessarily breast cancer.	OPINION
Please understand that we are not doctors and if we cannot answer your questions it is because we simply do not know what else to say except to have the biopsy.	OPINION
I have dense breasts (matches my head), and have had issues with my left one.	EXPERIENCE
I have history of lactation with pituitary tumor but no kids (my health in general bites).	EXPERIENCE
Long story short, had to have an MRI and the report says I have on the left : 7mm irregular mass with non- circumscribed edges, washout (fast uptake).	EXPERIENCE
The right side has an 8mm oval circumscribed mass, washout (fast uptake) associated with a 23 mm clumped, segmental non mass enhancement.	EXPERIENCE
I have to wait until October for the biopsies ...	EXPERIENCE
Ugh!	NOT_LABELED
Thoughts?	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I am so sorry you are going through this difficult time waiting for a biopsy, but as you well know, only a biopsy can tell for sure what is going on.	OPINION
One of the problems with MRIs is that they present a lot of false positives.	FACT
Many benign lesions show up on a MRI looking quite similar to cancerous lesions therefore anything that looks suspicious, additional testing becomes necessary.	FACT
Until your lesion is checked under the microscope, there is no way to know if it is cancer.	FACT
Having ``"washout kinetics"'' makes it suspicious, but you could still end up with benign results.	OPINION
Hang in there and we hope that your biopsy procedure will go smoothly and results in benign findings.	OPINION
All the best to you and good luck!	NOT_LABELED
Thanks ...	NOT_LABELED
I am a cl in Brain/pituitary and already dealt with 5 other tumors so hoping for benign.	EXPERIENCE
Will let you know..	NOT_LABELED

Hi, I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis.	OPINION

Breast cancer is a treatable disease since new technologies and many advanced treatments are available these days.	FACT

Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
Its rather unusual to have cancer in both breasts, but unfortunately it can occur and I am really sorry that this happened to you.	OPINION
Even if you are one of the few women to experience cancer bilaterally, the scenario is not as dire as it sounds.	OPINION
Many studies have shown that a woman's prognosis is not necessarily worse if she has breast cancer in both breasts, and that the outcomes in such cases are often excellent.	FACT
Although each breast may require a different treatment strategy, the overall treatment for breast cancer in both breasts is no different than for cancer that occurs in just one breast.	FACT
The good thing is that the tumor in your right breast is rather small and is ER/PR positive which will respond well to medication, such as Tamoxifen or other similar drugs to lower considerably the risk of recurrence.	OPINION
The tumor in your left breast is Grade 1 which is also a good thing.	OPINION
Its going to be a long journey but do not be disheartened.	OPINION
Take one step at a time, follow your Doctors recommendation and I am sure you you will be able to beat this disease like many of us did.	OPINION
Wishing you all the best and successful outcome.	OPINION
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Will keep you posted on the other tests ...	NOT_LABELED
I have a known lung mass, but benign it is thought.	EXPERIENCE
Joyï¿½	NOT_LABELED
More testing ...	EXPERIENCE
More waiting.	EXPERIENCE
The left side is different being er+, pr- and her-.	EXPERIENCE
The right is er+ . pr+, her-.	EXPERIENCE
I still will get the medicines just thought it was strange.	EXPERIENCE
So I spent the day making a bunch of pre-op clearance appointments and the gene doctor (which will be after).	EXPERIENCE
I am opting for the double mastectomy.	EXPERIENCE
I could have done the lumpectomy but with my history and the placement of the tumors, I would have been very lopsided so the double is a better choice and I may avoid radiation which can also be a better choice (I need it elsewhere and trying to avoid as much as I can).	OPINION
They are sing if I can get a ct and bone scan before surgery as well.	EXPERIENCE
Hi, emergency room (Estrogen) and PR (Progesterone) receptor status tests are done to show whether or not one or both of those hormones fuel your tumor.	FACT
Estrogen positive, even if it is weak, medication such as Tamoxifen (or other similar drugs) is usually recommended to lower the risk of recurrence in the same breast and helps prevent new cancer in the opposite breast.	FACT
Cancer that is hormone-sensitive is slightly slower growing and has a better chance of responding to hormone-suppression drugs, than cancer that is hormone receptor negative.	FACT
HER-2/neu negative cancer is also a good thing, because it is considered less aggressive than HER-2 positive.	FACT
I am sure that your Doctors will explain all this to you in details, when you you will meet them.	OPINION
Since you have decided on a double mastectomy, I will send you a link by PM.	FACT
Wishing you all the best and I hope that everything goes smoothly for you.	NOT_LABELED
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
i am sorry to hear about your diagnoses.	OPINION

I am trying to prepare ahead of time, but still feeling stressed.	EXPERIENCE
Yes I knowï¿½the waiting is very stressful, but try not to get discouraged!	OPINION
Please remember that ``"Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes"'' The important thing here is that you have found Doctors who are very experienced with this type of surgery, and especially knowing that you are in good hands.	OPINION

I wish you well! God Bless!	NOT_LABELED
Hello!	NOT_LABELED
Just an update.	NOT_LABELED
Doing my pre-op appointments.	FACT
For sure I am getting the DIEP which is nice.	OPINION
There was a question because I had so many surgeries.	FACT
My lung function has improved so that should not be an issue.	EXPERIENCE
I only have my blood tests to go but given that I have those all the time, I do not have an fear that those will have an issue.	EXPERIENCE
My ekg was fine (except for the lady ripping off the stickers and leaving me bruises, why will not they listen!!!	EXPERIENCE
I am even more nervous as the day gets closer about how to manage post operation, and just hoping I will not need chemotherapy.	EXPERIENCE
I know these are small, but every surgery so far things have turned out to be different (i.e . Larger) than imaging showed so just hope this history does not continue.	EXPERIENCE
I have no idea as well how I am going to manage my one cat who is very attached to me ...	FACT
He is going to be a mess with a restriction of not being able to be with me during the day and will body slam the door.	FACT
I am hoping I can keep him calm somehow!	OPINION
Hi there, Thank you for the update and I am glad to know that all the tests you have had so far, are fine and that you you will have DIEP breast reconstruction.	OPINION
Excellent choice!	NOT_LABELED
Its understandable that you are feeling nervous right now! but as soon as things get rolling, all will go well and you you will feel much better.	OPINION
I also hope you will not need chemotherapy! we know it is not easy to go through this therapy, but if Oncologists recommended it, it is very important to follow their advice because it does save lives.	OPINION
I hope you have read Sue Youngs information about post-op care that I sent you a few weeks ago (Link below) When you are well prepared and know what to expect, I am sure your recovery will be quicker than you think.	OPINION

At least you have a good idea of what to expect, after reading Sue Youngsexcellent post about preparing for bilateral mastectomy (the link for which I providedin my 10/17/15 comment, above).	OPINION
I certainly understand your nervousness; it is a lot to deal with, right down to ``"pet parent"'' concerns.	OPINION

I wish we did have a cat sitter but alas he has had a lot of urinary issues and my only option would be to put him down as he is not a cat I can foster out due to his special needs.	EXPERIENCE
His sister is calm.	OPINION
I did get come essential oils and put them around and he was calm for a day ...	EXPERIENCE
Today he is picking up on my nerves and is a whiny mess ...	EXPERIENCE
: / I am just hoping we can work around him.	OPINION
Hi again, Actually, I meant would someone be staying with you at first who might be able to calm him at least a little when he wants to be in your room and cannot be.	OPINION
Was it your doctor who said he cannot be with you?	FACT
For how long?	NOT_LABELED
By the way, by my comments I do not mean to suggest you have not already thought of every possible thing, esp.knowing your pet so well.	OPINION
I just hate to think of your having to worry a lot about him at the same time you are going through everything.	OPINION
: - (I know a bit about the additional stress pet concerns can because, because at one point when my husband was vey sick, I had to put our dog in our Vets hospital for a while.	EXPERIENCE
They had wire cages with a tray a few inches below to catch everything when no one was there to take him out as often as usual.	EXPERIENCE
He was old and had never been away from us, so we were worried about him, but they said he adjusted okay, and he did not seem traumatized when he came home.	EXPERIENCE
Ill be thinking of you next week.	NOT_LABELED
Please let us know how you are doing once you are feeling well enough.	NOT_LABELED
baby.	NOT_LABELED
I am popping in today.	EXPERIENCE
I am thankfully Stage I. I get my oncotyping on Friday.	EXPERIENCE
I am having tons of post operation complications like an infected drain, so that was popped out, then I got an abscess, another drain put in and I got cellulitis on the other side.	EXPERIENCE
My belly was rock hard and bright red.	EXPERIENCE
It is still part hard and red still.	EXPERIENCE
The up and down fevers are driving me nuts.	EXPERIENCE
I am hot, cold, hot, cold.	EXPERIENCE
The cat was for the most part good.	EXPERIENCE
He was calm when I came home and while he wanted to be with me, he was patient to a point..	EXPERIENCE
by the time he did jump up on me, I was ready, although he did get me once when I was sleeping.	EXPERIENCE
Once he got the hang of it though, it has been good.	EXPERIENCE
Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
i have been thinking of you often and wondered how you were doing.	NOT_LABELED
I am happy that your tumor is stage one, but sorry to know that you experienced a few complication after your surgery.	OPINION
I hope that you are doing better now and hopefully medication will take care of the infection and fever soon.	OPINION
I also hope that your Oncotype test will be low (18 or less) indicating that there is a much lower chance that the breast cancer will return and most probably chemotherapy will not be necessary.	OPINION
P.S . Your cat seemed to discern that you were not feeling your best and he is indeed a very good pet!	OPINION

Hi I just did a follow up ultra sound, on a lump that my radiologist had been following for a year and a half.	EXPERIENCE
My results said that it grew and changed from 5mm to 9mm diagnoses bi raids 4 so i had the biopsy doctor calls and said that tissues are benign.	EXPERIENCE
Then he proceeds to tell me that i have a intraductal papilloma 9mm.	EXPERIENCE
he then stated that i need and excisional biopsy time to see a breast surgent, during the conversation he stated that it is very rare that these are cancer only a 5% chance.	EXPERIENCE
So my questions is can i leave this alone i prefer to just follow it?	FACT
If i left it in and it did turn to cancer what could the outcome be how dangerous could it get even if i am being followed.	FACT
I again would prefer to just leave it alone.	OPINION
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
I would NOT just leave it alone and I cannot imagine why anyone would choose to do this.	OPINION
5% may not seem much of a chance to you but even a 1% chance would send me to a Breast Surgeon immediately.	OPINION
You can do whatever you feel comfortable with but since there has been growth give it some more thought before you decide to ignore this condition.	OPINION
Even if you do see a Breast Surgeon there is a chance that he/she may agree with waiting and doing close interval testing and the choice will still be yours and yours alone.	OPINION
Please at least see the Surgeon, OK??	NOT_LABELED

Hi thank you for your feed back.	NOT_LABELED
I am seeing a breast sergeant on Thursday december 3ird.	FACT
I have also schedule a appointment for a second opinion in January of 2016.	FACT
Please know that i am concerned and do not take this lightly, but for me i have had so many scares and they have thank goodness all come back benign.	EXPERIENCE
It is scary but for me i feel maybe it would just be better to follow this and see if there is a change.	OPINION
I will post more on Thursday when i have the results.	NOT_LABELED
Regards.....	NOT_LABELED
Great to hear that you are going to keep seeking a definite answer.	OPINION
i am all for second opinions and I believe that a person should keep seeking information until they are comfortable with all the answers.	OPINION
When I hear ``"do not worry about it"'' I always want to know ``"WHY"'' I should not worry :) Always appreciate follow-ups.... Thanks.	OPINION
I think you made the right choice, for sure!	OPINION

I was initially diagnosed with intraductal papilloma (after a biopsy came back negative for cancer).	EXPERIENCE
I had this removed.	EXPERIENCE
My pathology results came back with DCIS.	EXPERIENCE
i have since had a recurrence.	EXPERIENCE
There is some debate about whether mammograms and surgery actually spread the disease.	FACT
Cancer if left untreated can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.	OPINION
I do not necessarily think that conventional medicine has all the answers.	OPINION
Some people have had really amazing results with lifestyle medicine.	OPINION
You need to do what feels right to you.	OPINION
Intuition is a valuable tool.	OPINION
Good luck with whatever you decide.	NOT_LABELED
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
Hi Thank you for all your feed back, I spoke with the breast Sergent on Thursday and asked a lot questions.	EXPERIENCE
The doctor i thought was so supportive she answered all my questions and then some.	EXPERIENCE
When asked she told me she has recently had a patient whose papilloma results cancer.	EXPERIENCE
According to the new statistics 20 to 30% chance intraductal papilloma being cancer.	FACT
numbers increased great, I still have a second opinion in January, Do to the biopsy i have a 3cm hematoma and i am very bruised the radiologist change his plan and did a vacuum core biopsy instead of just a core biopsy, which is fine.	EXPERIENCE
The doctor told me if i choose to do the extensional she would have to wait for the hematoma to dissipate as they would not be able to get to the area.	EXPERIENCE
And if i choose to be followed she would follow me every three months twice and then move to 6 months, I left telling her i would be in touch.	EXPERIENCE
I am confused now but i will wait for my second opinion appointment do research shop for the holidays and pray that i make the right decision in the end.	EXPERIENCE
Scared!!!	EXPERIENCE
It sounds as though you have found a GREAT Surgeon who has exactly the right information and caring that you need.	OPINION
The follow-up plan seems very appropriate and I would be comfortable with that myself.	OPINION
I do think it wise to go ahead with the second opinion to further clear things in your mind.	OPINION
The hematoma issue is not at all unusual in such circumstances with biopsies but it can complicate the situation.	OPINION
Remember that the decision you make today or 3 months from now will not necessarily change the outcome.	OPINION
Even though papilloma can be cancer, if there is only one they are usually watched for a period of time.	FACT
you are on the right track but try not to confuse yourself by doing TOO much research as no 2 cases are the same and you cannot depend too much on percentages, they are too general.	OPINION
Take care and stay busy.... NO negative thinking!!	OPINION
Hi I went for my second opinion, Not sure what to make of the appointment though.	EXPERIENCE
This doctor is a top breast Sergent in my area, She actually did my first breast surgery in 2008.	EXPERIENCE
When i saw her i felt like she was a little pushy, She said to me it grew and surgery was the best route even though i do not have any of the symptoms and the biopsy came back benign.	EXPERIENCE
She quoted to me (Pathology report too consider excision).	EXPERIENCE
When i ask questions i felt like she thought i was stupid and she did not want to answer questions she cut me off, proceeded to tell me two options surgery or follow every six months.	EXPERIENCE
My question which i think is important does anyone know?	OPINION
Are there any studies of women who were follow with intraductal papilloma what is the long term out come.	FACT
that is too bad that you had a less than comfortable experience with the Breast Surgeon; perhaps she was having a bad day????	OPINION
At this point since the chance of a single papilloma being malignant is rather small you might as well follow it for the recommended 6 months.	OPINION
This all began the last of November and you should count the 6 months from that date and see what is recommended at your next check-up which would be in the Spring.	OPINION
If at that time it is determined to be benign then it can be left alone.	OPINION
On the other hand if you are ``"done"'' with all the re-checks and possible biopsies then have it removed and over with.	OPINION
It all comes down to what you are comfortable with.	OPINION
I would make my appointment now for the 6 month check-up if that is the way you intend to go so there will be no waiting when the time actually arrives.	OPINION
Regards....	NOT_LABELED
Hi doctor is going to do a lumpectomy on the 23ird of February.	FACT
I did a lot of hard thinking research and reading decided it is too much stress, and i ask my self would i have any regrets with my decision if it changed.	EXPERIENCE
Surgery is better way to go.	OPINION
My radiologist stated excision but my doctor is doing a wired lumpectomy is this normal procedure and what is the difference between the 2 surgerys I have done a little reading but still a little confused.	EXPERIENCE
I am nerves about the surgery but more then anything I have a fear of being put to sleep!	EXPERIENCE
I know I will be fine but still a little scary.	OPINION
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
I really do not see any difference in the two.	OPINION
The area is being removed either way.	FACT
It seems to me that this is just the use of different terminology.	OPINION

Hi so the surgery went well The doctor got everything.	EXPERIENCE
Now three days later getting back to my self pain is not to bad, I have been taking Tylenol.	EXPERIENCE
Still waiting on the results.	EXPERIENCE
Do i really have to wait three weeks before i can get fully back into normal daily activitys?	FACT
That does seem rather a long time but it depends upon exactly what your normal activity consists of, like strenuous exercise which would not be wise or several other things that would put undue strain on muscles, etc.	OPINION
I would increase your activities very gradually but NEVER go against the advice of the Surgeon.	OPINION
Complete healing of the tissues does take quite some time and you certainly would not want to delay that.	OPINION
i am glad to hear the things went well and hope for GREAT news when the reports come in.	OPINION
Do take it easy though.... Regards.	NOT_LABELED
When I went in for my mammogram, I was told that my benign scattered calcifications that I had for the last 2 years were misread and are actually fine, linear calcifications, but because they were stable for 2 years they told me to come back in 6 months.	EXPERIENCE
They gave me a BI RADS 3.	EXPERIENCE
When I got my report, my breast density was reported as extremely dense.	EXPERIENCE
I have always had heterogeneously dense breasts.	EXPERIENCE
I have since done a lot of googling and cannot understand why they would not biopsy.	EXPERIENCE
I have found out that DCIS can be stable for a while and that the morphology is more important than the stability over time.	FACT
Why would they wait!	OPINION
I am so scared!	OPINION
Do they know what they are doing?	FACT
Thoughts please?	NOT_LABELED
Hi.Experienced Radiologists are quite able to identify typically benign breast calcifications depending on their form and pattern.	FACT
If no suspicion is detected a biopsy is not required to prevent unnecessary procedures.	FACT
BIRADS Category 3, means that the findings have a very high probability of being benign, therefore recommending a short-interval follow-up.	FACT
I would not worry so much if I were you, because what your radiologist has recommended is standard procedure.	OPINION
If these calcification were suspicious in any way, I am sure a biopsy would have certainly been ordered.	OPINION
But of course this is up to you to decide!.	OPINION
if you still feel uncomfortable waiting six months for a follow up, you could always have your films read by another Radiologist for a second opinion, or ask your Doctor to order a biopsy.	OPINION
Best wishes ...	NOT_LABELED
Thank you for your answer.	NOT_LABELED
I do not understand why I have to have a mammogram in 6 months.	OPINION
Why cannot I just get one in 1 year?	OPINION
I do not think BI RADS 3 is very useful to have to spend the extra money to watch something that is benign.	OPINION
When will I ever go back to once a year mammograms?	FACT
Hi again, You have been asked to have these calcification monitored every 6 month simply because when the radiologist assigns calcifications to a ``"probably benign"'' category, the risk of malignancy even if very low (less than 2 %) can change unexpectedly.	FACT
Typically these calcifications will be monitored every six months for at least one year.	FACT
Assuming that no new changes are found, your doctor will recommend you have a routine mammogram once a year.	FACT
I hope that you you will follow your doctors recommendation to make sure there is no change in the size, shape or number of calcifications.	OPINION
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
My calcifications have already been stable for over 2 years.	EXPERIENCE
Can you show me any resource that says if a radiologist sees fine, linear calcifications to ``"wait and see"'' for six months?	FACT
If they want them stable for a year, I have been stable for more than 2 years.	FACT
I have not seen 1 resource where it is recommended that fine, linear calcifications be put in the BI RADS 3 or 2 categories.	OPINION
My mammograms have all been the same, the only difference is that the radiologists have misread them.	EXPERIENCE
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
If the calcifications can change unexpectedly, then is the risk still less than 2 %?	FACT
If they have not changed in 2 years, what is the risk they will change in 2 1/2 years , 3 years, etc ...	FACT
I really cannot say why your Radiologist asked you to follow-up in 6 months since your calcifications have been stable for 2 years.	FACT
Linear calcification is not always indicative of malignancy.	FACT
The suspicion is raised only when they are clustered and appear to form several branches.	FACT
When they are linear but detached, such as probably yours are, it is usually not worrisome but they have to be monitored regularly.	FACT
I wish I could give you more information about the things you are requesting here, but the only advice I can give you is to have your Mammogram films read by a different Radiologist for a second opinion and also to have your test report explained to you in details by your Doctor who is your best source of information.	OPINION
I wish you well ...	NOT_LABELED
Thank you zouzi for the information.	NOT_LABELED
I do not understand if they are not worrisome, why watch them?	OPINION
It seems like a waste of resources.	OPINION
What benign condition is linear but detached calcifications?	FACT
You are welcome.	NOT_LABELED
I do not know what else to tell you ..	NOT_LABELED
I do not know what else to tell you .. except that monitoring closely ``"probably benign"'' calcification is standard procedure and in my opinion it is not a waste of resources if we want to make sure that our breasts are healthy and stay healthy.	OPINION
If you are terribly worried about these calcifications, please take my advice and seek a second opinion from a different radiologist who might recommend a biopsy (if necessary) so you can have peace of mind.	OPINION
It appears from the many posts on this forum regarding incisions opening after lumpectomies that it must be pretty common.	FACT
I had a lumpectomy on March 12.	EXPERIENCE
Two weeks later, it opened overnight.	EXPERIENCE
In the morning it was oozing & bleeding.	EXPERIENCE
I returned to the surgeon, who said it was infected.	EXPERIENCE
I was given antibiotics.	EXPERIENCE
My oncologist looked at it a week later and said it was no longer infected, but to return to the surgeon if it looked like it was not healing.	EXPERIENCE
Part of the incision is slowly healing, but a new section opened and is bleeding slightly.	EXPERIENCE
I keep it covered with gauze to keep it clean.	EXPERIENCE
How long shoud I give this to heal?	FACT
I had an infection post surgery and it took four weeks to heal completely.	EXPERIENCE
My wound was deep and had to be packed.	EXPERIENCE
Wounds heal from the bottom up.	EXPERIENCE
Healing seemed to be very slow but then it just went.	EXPERIENCE
Actually it was a bit longer.	EXPERIENCE
My incision burst on the 24th December (following surgery on the 19th december) and it was fully healed by the 5th february.	EXPERIENCE
I hope yours is OK and that everything goes well for you.	NOT_LABELED
Just be patient.	OPINION
Time frames are different for everyone.	FACT
If you have any concerns make sure you get them checked out.	OPINION
J.	NOT_LABELED
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
I did not expect this to happen at all with the healing of the incision.	OPINION
My surgeon did not seem concerned.	EXPERIENCE
He surely sees it all the time.	OPINION
Its good to be reassured.	OPINION
I am so glad to have this site with all who care so much about one another.	OPINION
So it is been about a month or so since the wound opened.	EXPERIENCE
That part seems to be healing.	EXPERIENCE
There is another section that after all this time, that decided to open the other day.	EXPERIENCE
Its small and bleeding just a little.	EXPERIENCE
Ill give it some more time.	FACT
Thank you again and I hope everything is ok with you now.	NOT_LABELED
I did not either.	NOT_LABELED
Personally I did not expect to get an infection and definitely did not anticipate needing district nursing input.	OPINION
Perhaps I took recovery for granted as I healed really well, and quickly, after having a duct out during a previous operation.	EXPERIENCE
It is good if a surgeon does not seem concerned -I think.	OPINION
Bleeding is a good sign as it denotes healthy tissue.	FACT
Too much bleeding is not though.	FACT
i have really benefited from this site and the support, advice and information too.	OPINION
Its been invaluable.	OPINION
I expect that section too will heal.	OPINION
I think it is normal for us to become anxious, etc during our recoveries.	OPINION
This is all new to us and we are learning about ourselves and our bodies during this process.	OPINION
I had stitches poke through my skin too.	EXPERIENCE
Just when I thought Id healed I found this thing on my breast.	EXPERIENCE
I was scared it had become infected again but it was only a mushy little stitch which I pulled out myself.	EXPERIENCE
( The stitch was redundant anyhow as the surgical registrar had cut it to insert a drain for the infection).	EXPERIENCE
you are welcome.	NOT_LABELED
i am fine.	NOT_LABELED
i have just finished radiation treatment and are getting over residual fatigue.	EXPERIENCE
Just be vigilant about your breast (without making it worse) and discuss any concerns you have with your doctor.	OPINION
J.	NOT_LABELED
A related discussion, was started.	NOT_LABELED
Hello.	NOT_LABELED
I am having the same problem.	EXPERIENCE
My wound is still open after 5 weeks.	EXPERIENCE
I have to and see surgeon on Monday and likely have it packed and changed daily she said.	EXPERIENCE
This *****!!!	NOT_LABELED
My radiation has been delayed by several weeks they said until healed.	EXPERIENCE
My question is, does it hurt to have packing.	FACT
I have never had it before and am a little overwhelmed.	EXPERIENCE
This is a very old thread.	FACT
I would suggest you start your own new thread.	OPINION
If you describe the details of your situation and ask your questions there, you will be more likely to get answers addressed specifically to you and your concerns.	OPINION
Best wishes.	NOT_LABELED
Radiation does delay healing so that is why you are being delayed for that part of your treatment.	FACT
As far as the packing is concerned, if the area is not painful at the present then I doubt that it will be terribly uncomfortable.	OPINION
I have had a couple of areas that required packing and I had no pain but it was not in the same area as yours.	EXPERIENCE
The amount of discomfort with the packing and removing it daily would also depend on the depth of the wound.	FACT
here's hoping it will be effective and not because you very much discomfort.	OPINION
Hang in there, these things do happen now and then but they can be overcome with a little extra time.	OPINION
Kindest regards....	NOT_LABELED
I had a 3D mammo because of a large mass in my right breast.	EXPERIENCE
I was told a 3D is much more accurate than a standard mammo.	EXPERIENCE
Nobody would tell me the result of this but now they say I need an ultrasound.	EXPERIENCE
If the 3D is so accurate why would they need an ultrasound?	FACT
That means cancer, right?	OPINION
Nobody willtellme anything and I amso scared.	OPINION
I am so sorry you are not getting clear answers.	OPINION
My doctor pretty much told me from me 2nd mammo (6 month follow up) and u/s that they believed I had cancer.	EXPERIENCE
And another told me the same thing before my biopsy.	EXPERIENCE
I believe there is a truth in the saying ``"No news is good news"''.	OPINION
I know it is hard, and nerve wracking, and Damn Scary!	OPINION
But, you can handle this!	OPINION
Maybe take a family member or friend with you to your appts to take notes.	OPINION
that is what I did.	EXPERIENCE
And seriously, I would read the notes taken the next day and not remember 3/4 of what was written, or I would remember things completely different then what was actually said.	EXPERIENCE
Your head is spinning ...	EXPERIENCE
you are scared!	EXPERIENCE
I hope you get answers soon!!!	OPINION
Hang in there!	NOT_LABELED
I believe I addressed your concerns in my response to your post of July 14th.	OPINION
At that time I mentioned that Mammogram and Ultrasound were sometimes necessary to determine the nature of any finding in the breast.	FACT
You need to speak to your Dr. for answers regarding your concerns and I believe I advised this also in my previous response.	OPINION
You evidently have been told quite a lot here as well as from your Dr. and the Radiologist that read your films.	OPINION
Please speak to the Dr., or his/her Nurse who ordered your tests.	OPINION
They have all your information and know the answers and will be more than happy to explain things to you.	OPINION
As I stated before Cancer cannot be determined until a biopsy is done so be patient and take things one step at a time and ASK questions of the Professionals who are treating you.	OPINION
Kindest regards....	NOT_LABELED
I am terrified and confused and cannot remember the many, many things I have been told in the last few days and that includes posts here.	EXPERIENCE
But you are wrong--no one has been ``"more than happy"'' to explain things.	EXPERIENCE
The medical professionals have not been forthcoming, they have been elusive and reluctant which leads me to believe they are hiding something very bad.	EXPERIENCE
i am sorry but there is no way that we or your Dr.s can make you remember what you have been told about these circumstances.	OPINION
Perhaps you could ask you family Dr. for some type of medication that would help in calming these fears that you seem to have about cancer.	OPINION
I will try one more time to assure you that the Dr.s certainly are NOT trying to hide anything from you ...	OPINION
why in world would they do that??	FACT
For the third time I will say that there are no answers until all your tests have been completed and only a biopsy can diagnose cancer.... not size nor how something looks on film.	OPINION
It also might help if you would call your Dr..s office and ask for a copy of the reports on the tests that have been done so far.	OPINION
At the bottom of the page there is always an ``"opinion"'' as well as some recommendation as to what should be done next.	FACT
I would also like to ask if in the future you have more questions, you would add them to the same post so that all your information is together.	FACT
It makes it much easier for us to get the compete picture and would even be a help to you to be able to read what you have ask as well as our answers since you say you have trouble remembering what you are being told.	FACT
Call you Dr..... ask the Nurse ...	OPINION
read the reports or better yet have them read and explained to you but do not expect answers before there are answers.	OPINION
Every test that is done has a different purpose and they are always used in combination to get an accurate conclusion.	FACT
Regards.....	NOT_LABELED

Checking to see if you have had your ultrasound yet??	FACT
After a clear mammogram and ultrasound, I was sent for an Mri because of family history.	EXPERIENCE
A suspicious 1cm mass popped and now I need a biopsy.	EXPERIENCE
Should I be terrified?	OPINION
Too lateï¿½I am..help.	OPINION
This discussion is related to.	NOT_LABELED
I see no reason to panic at this point.	OPINION
MRI is a much more sensitive type of test and can often show things that other tests do not.	FACT
A biopsy of course is the only sure way to diagnose what this mass represents.	FACT
It could be a Fibroadenoma which is a benign breast tumor.	OPINION
I would be surprised that a mass of this size representing cancer would not have shown up on either the Mammogram or Ultrasound.	OPINION
Proceed with the recommended biopsy which will define more accurately what you are dealing with.	OPINION
Being terrified never helps and usually tends to cloud your vision as well as your thoughts.	OPINION
I imagine that you are seeing a Breast Specialist but if not this is something that you need to arrange.	OPINION
Family history accounts for a very small percentage of diagnosed cases of Breast Cancer even though it is a risk factor.	FACT

Biopsy is on Thursday.	FACT

We know how it is but whatever it is we always seem to be able to handle it.	OPINION
Let us know when you get your results.... Regards.	FACT
It has Been a while since I have logged on.	FACT
The mass was triple negative cancer.	EXPERIENCE
I had a lumpectomy lAst week.	EXPERIENCE
It was a 1 cm mass with clear margins and no nodes involved..	EXPERIENCE
Thank God!	NOT_LABELED
Still need chemotherapy though.ugh!	EXPERIENCE
Meeting with the oncologist next week.	FACT
I was not so afraid of the surgery, it is the thought of chemotherapy that is flipping me out!	EXPERIENCE
Any thoughts or words of advice?	FACT
Thanks for the update.... sounds as though you have done well so far and it is a GREAT thing that nodes were not involved.	OPINION
As far as the chemotherapy goes, it is hard to say.	OPINION
Everyone and their response to the drugs is so varied you you will just have to wait and see.... great advice, right??	OPINION
Seriously, some women can breeze through it with little or no problem and others have adverse reactions.	FACT
Keep positive thoughts and do not go looking for ``"what might occur"'' and do not hesitate to make clear any problems you may have.	OPINION
The Oncology team will have many things that will help with or counteract any side effects that you experience.	FACT
do not keep it to yourself; make it known if you have a problem of any kind.	OPINION
Wishing you a good experience during your treatment.... you can do it, I know you can!!	OPINION
Take care and keep us posted when you have the time.	OPINION
Kindest regards....	NOT_LABELED
Trying g to keep positive, but it is quite hard at times.	EXPERIENCE
Do you think Ill be needing a petscan before chemotherapy?	FACT
Breast doctor says no.	FACT
We will see what the oncologist says.	FACT
I am really not up for any more scans at this point.	EXPERIENCE
Just want to deal with the matter at hand and get it over with.	FACT
Maybe and maybe not..... Oncologists all have their routine before, during and after treatment so it is really up to him/her.	FACT
Considering all the other issues one more scan would be far down on the worry list.	OPINION
i am sure you will be having them after treatment and perhaps routinely for a period of time.	OPINION
Usually there are yearly check-ups with oncologist . or possibly 6 months at first when you have finished treatment.	FACT
Some Oncologists see patients for a couple of years and some will see the patient as long as the patient wishes.	FACT
Its a very individual thing with the Oncologists.	FACT
Just hang in there; you know it will not be over in a moment.... all things take time and we all have a problem being patient when it comes to WAITING.	OPINION
Do you best, you have done a SUPER job so far; do not spoil your record.... Take care now.	OPINION
Thanks for the kind words.	NOT_LABELED
Is 3 weeks post operation a long time before seeing the oncologist?	FACT
i am hearing no because you need time to heal.	FACT
WAiting and being anxious really *****!	EXPERIENCE
No, not at all.... healing is a complicated process in the tissues below the surface.	FACT
There will seem to be no end to the ``"waiting"'' but it is all a learning experience.	OPINION
After all is said and done you will be a much more patient person..... hopefully :).	OPINION
take care.....	NOT_LABELED
Hi everyone, i am so anxious at the moment.	EXPERIENCE
i am having nightmares and not sleeping well.	EXPERIENCE
I had an ultrasound which showed : 7x3x7 mm breast lesion 2cm from nipple.	EXPERIENCE
Hypoechoic with some through transmission.	EXPERIENCE
Small echogenic foci are identified within.	EXPERIENCE
No vasculariry or architectural distortion.	EXPERIENCE
It may represent a fibroadenoma however there does appear to be some tapering suggesting ductal in origin.	EXPERIENCE
How likely is this to be cancer?	FACT
i am seeing specialist on tuedsay.	FACT
The report says it suggest a a biopsy.	FACT
I have a 2 year old son and I breast fed him for 1.5 years.	EXPERIENCE
I thought this would have been protective.	OPINION
i am really after some support and some insight as to how likely this is something nasty.I actually went in to see my doctor as I had other lumps which just turned out to be benign glandular tissue- just part of my breast anatomy and then they found this unexpected lesion: - (Joanne.	EXPERIENCE
Hi, Please try not to panic!	NOT_LABELED
Most breast lesions are not cancerous.	FACT
A variety of benign breast lumps like fibroadenoma or cysts do appear suspicious on x-rays sometimes, but it is nothing more than that.	FACT
The fact that the report states that no vasculariry (blood flow) or architectural distortion is present, it is a good sign!	FACT
Most biopsy are recommended just to make sure and it is an excellent medical procedure to obtain a correct diagnosis!	FACT
Try not to worry....Hopefully this is nothing to be concerned about.	OPINION
Wishing you all the best!	NOT_LABELED
Thanks zouzi.	NOT_LABELED
I do not think it is a cyst because it is not clear, has calcifications in it: / that is what the radiologist said to me.	OPINION
And it has some tapering so not a nice well circumcised lesion, all risk factors for malignancy from what I have read.	EXPERIENCE
I feel too young to have cancer.	OPINION
But then i have read that it can happen any age.	EXPERIENCE
You are welcome Joanne, I do not think it is a cyst either, I just mentioned that some cysts could also look suspicious	OPINION
What you have is most probably a Fibroadenoma which is a solid lump that needs to be biopsied to make sure that in fact it is a benign lesion, which could also present with calcification and not well circumcised.	OPINION
Many breast lumps that need to be investigated are not necessarily malignant but the only way to make sure is to have a biopsy.	FACT
Hoping that all turns out fine for you!	NOT_LABELED
:).	NOT_LABELED
there is just so many stories of young women who are fighting this that i have read about in the last week on the internet.	FACT
Its make things seem more probable.	OPINION
Whatever the result, this experience has made me realize that I need to change the way I live And live a bit more for today.	EXPERIENCE
I have never felt so anxious or scared in my life.	EXPERIENCE
Ill never take my life for granted again.	FACT
i am amazed at how my this has changed me.	EXPERIENCE
Yes, I know that the possibility of ``"breast cancer"'' can because a lot of stress and anxiety, but remember that reading stories over the internet about women with BC is not necessarily related to your situation at all, since you have not been diagnosed with anything yet.	OPINION
Try your best to stay calm and do not let your mind be filled with negative thoughts.	OPINION
Keep in mind that many breast lumps are not cancerous, even suspicious ones...and I hope the same for you too.	OPINION
Please let us know when you receive your biopsy results and lets hope for a favorable outcome.	OPINION
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
Ok Ill let you know.	NOT_LABELED
I just had a look to the sonographers report and she wrote cystic and solid components present with calcifications.	EXPERIENCE
that is a good thing right?	OPINION
I am sure that your Doctor can explain to you in details your complete Ultrasound report.	OPINION
In your first post, you mentioned that the Radiologist stated that the lump may represent a Fibroadenoma but now you say that it is a cyst containing solid components.All I can tell you is that breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex cysts.	FACT
Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy.	FACT
However, complicated cysts are a little more concerning.	FACT
They are also fluid filled sacs but contain some solid material (debris).	FACT
Usually complicated cysts are aspirated and have the cells examined to better evaluate the nature of the cyst and the majority will results in benign findings when biopsied.	FACT
I am sorry if I cannot help you more, but I would advise you to visit your Doctor concerning your Ultrasound results, because he/she would be your best source of information.	OPINION
Ok thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Yeah what is happened is I have a copy of what the sonographer wrote, and the final report of what the radiologist wrote.	FACT
This is where there are different descriptions.	FACT
Sonopgrapher wrote cystic and solid components but the final report has what I wrote originally.	FACT
Even i am confused as to who is correct!	FACT
I just responded to your private message.	FACT
What are the chances treating this type of cancer with radiation only?	FACT
Does the statistics change any and if so, can you tell me the percentage!	FACT
Hi . Invasive ductal carcinoma cannot be cured by radiation alone.	FACT
At the very least, a mastectomy or lumpectomy (surgery removing a part of the breast along with the tumor) should be done.	FACT
If the tumor is small (less than or equal to 0.5 cm) and no tumor spread to the axillary nodes was found, then radiation treatment after the surgery may suffice.	FACT
But a larger tumor or metastases to the axillary nodes will require the addition of either chemotherapy or hormonal treatment, or both.	FACT
I recently under went a lumpectomy in July, I also has lymph nodes involved.	EXPERIENCE
The tumors were removed, my margins came back clear.	EXPERIENCE
I do not want to go through chemotherapy, I am willing to do radiation along with hepercin will this help me at all?	FACT
I think what the doctor is trying to tell you is that surgery in your case is necessary, and which you now say you had.	OPINION
He also said that especially if lymph nodes are involved, chemotherapy is highly recommended and the right way to go in your case.	OPINION
It will not guarantee that you will live forever but it will increase your chances of living longer.	FACT
I do understand what you are saying, after all meet tests from the muga scan to the mri bone scat and cat scan.	FACT
Blood work and so on, after all the tests came back would the doctors know if the cance has spresd to other area outside of my lymph nodes?	FACT
Hi.	NOT_LABELED
If the cancer has been found in the lymph nodes, there is a significant probability that there is already microscopic spread to other areas of the body.	FACT
This microscopic spread may not be easily detected by conventional imaging procedures.	FACT
So even if the initial tests were negative for distant metastases, if the lymph nodes are already involved, it is imperative to do some additional treatment like chemotherapy, since we are not sure that the negative results are totally reliable.	FACT
Is there a time lime to have chemotherapy?	FACT
, right now I am unable to have the chemotherapy due to financial reason.	FACT
I am not counting it out all together maybe sometime next year?	FACT
This is what I have been told.	EXPERIENCE
When you are first diagnosed, a team of doctors set up your treatment plan.	FACT
( or a doctor/doctors talk about what they think is the best thing to do in any particular case for the best possible outcome and prevention of reoccurrence).	FACT
Then, if the patient agrees to this, you go ahead with it.	FACT
If you do, then the initial treatments are really the most important of all the treatment, as the goal is to wipe out whatever cancer there is and may be lurking the very first time.	FACT
If you decide to do chemotherapy a year or so later, this will no longer be part of the initially recommended treatment that according to the doctors best judgment has the highest chance of working in your best interest.	FACT
Radiation will certainly help with reoccurrence, and it will attack whatever may have spread outside of the surgical area that was removed.	FACT
But as the doctor above explains, with positive lymph nodes there is a chance that the cancer has spread, and in half of the cases those lesions are so tiny that they will not show up on a bone scan or other test.	FACT
So, this is why chemotherapy is utilized to make sure that if this spread is there it is wiped out by chemotherapy immediately, because after the first chance the cancer will only spread and grow.	FACT
( I mean even with radiation, it will grow outside of the radiation area).	FACT
Radiation is local treatment just like surgery, and chemotherapy is systemic.	FACT
So is tamoxifen but it is not indicated in your case.	FACT
Do not put off chemotherapy because of financial reasons.	OPINION
There are breast cancer advocate organizations that can help you get treatment.	FACT
I think one of them is called youcanthrive.org, or something close to that.	OPINION
Find an advocate and get the treatment you need.	FACT
Your LIFE is more important than financial considerations.	OPINION
NOBODY in this country should have to risk recurrence of a life threatening disease because they cannot afford treatment.	OPINION
I had Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in 09.	EXPERIENCE
Treatment included 2 lumpectomies, chemotherapy and radiation.	EXPERIENCE
When cancer reaches your lymph nodes, you have no idea where the cancer cells have traveled through your body, therefore chemotherapy treatment is necessary.	FACT
Do you know of any more of the advocate and financial support groups?	FACT
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
4 1/2 years ago my mother has a cancerous lump taken out of her breast.	EXPERIENCE
SHE DID NO TREATMENTs.	EXPERIENCE
About a year ago she found another lump in the same breast but this time on the outside.	EXPERIENCE
She found a doctor that has been treating it.	EXPERIENCE
we thought it was getting better.	EXPERIENCE
Just a couple of months ago the same doctor who is in another state where we live ordered a bone scan her at home.	EXPERIENCE
The results according to this doctor were not good.	EXPERIENCE
He said there was nothing else he could do.	EXPERIENCE
We found a cancer doctor here at home.	EXPERIENCE
It is now in her lymph notes under her arm and in her chest and she also has another lump in the same breast inside again.	EXPERIENCE
It has been growing since her surgery 4 1/2 years ago.	EXPERIENCE
This doctor said it is not in any of her organs.	EXPERIENCE
All the natural stuff my mom was taking saved her organs.	EXPERIENCE
It is in her bones now.	EXPERIENCE
The doctor here will have them in a week.	EXPERIENCE
It only will be than that he will know what bones and how many the cancer is now in.	EXPERIENCE
Is it true once it reaches the bones it is stage 4?	OPINION
What can we expect, She also starts chemotherapy in one week.	EXPERIENCE
i am so sorry to learn of your Mothers present condition.	OPINION
Evidently she received very poor medical care when her first cancer was discovered.	OPINION
The fact that she now has metastisis to the bone is not the main issue as bone metastases is quite easliy managed.	OPINION
The lymph node involvement is the problem to be addressed first.	OPINION
I truly hope that you are being treated by an Oncologist and that she will not refuse whatever treatment that is recommended.	OPINION
The only proven treatment for cancer at any stage is a combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and possible Hormone Therapy following the appropriate surgery at the time the cancer is first discovered.	OPINION
As far as prognosis at this point; that would be something you should discuss with your Mothers Oncologist as he/she has all the necessary information regarding the cancer.	OPINION
Kindest regards ...	NOT_LABELED
So sorry to learn of your mothers health.... The first doctor apparently did not do his job aty all.	OPINION
By all means, seek the assistance of a good oncologist--but listen to his/her recommendations.	OPINION
They will almost always without a doubt recommend the chemotherapy protocol, which has NOT been proven to help the majority of those receiving it (less than 15 %).	OPINION
Remember one thing--and that is an oncologist job is to educate and inform patients only of what they are taught and told to relate to patients.	OPINION
Please do your research for your mother--it can save her life and give her peace of mind as well as quality of life.	OPINION
My prayers are with you.	NOT_LABELED
i have only gotten 2 responses to my post which either tell me there is something someone doest want to tell me or my concerns are not enough.	EXPERIENCE
Thanks for nothing.	NOT_LABELED
I am so sorry to hear about your mothers health.	NOT_LABELED
I can certainly appreciate your concern and your wish to get concrete answers.	OPINION
I am in a similar position having been recently diagnosed with metastases to the bones.	EXPERIENCE
From what I understand this means that the cancer is in stage IV.	EXPERIENCE
Information on the computer suggests that metastases to the bone and not to the vital organs are considered the ``"best"''.	FACT
My doctor said that she has seen a few patients live for 10 years in this condition.	EXPERIENCE
The danger is that the cancer will move to vital organs.	FACT
If you look on the computer the statistics for life with metastatic cancer are grim (2-3yrs) I have been assured that life expectancy can be much longer if the cancer can be stabilized.	EXPERIENCE
I am hoping that this will be true for me and I definitely hope that this will be true for your mother.	OPINION
I hope that this is somewhat helpful.	OPINION
I do not think any one, cancer patient or oncologist, is quick to put a life expectancy in absolute terms.	OPINION
I do understand, however, the wish to have certainty in such a vulnerable situation.	OPINION
Best wishes, jonji.	NOT_LABELED
i am sorry you felt that your concerns were not answered.	NOT_LABELED
I re-read your original post and found the only question to be ``"was bone metastases considered Stage 4"'' ..	FACT
Obviously your mother either refused treatment when she was first diagnosed and this is certainly the main reaosn for the recurrance.	FACT
Natural remedies DO NOT prevent or cure breast cancer.	FACT
As I mentioned before, bone metastases can be managed quite well and there are many Stage IV women who alive and living with the bone metastases.	FACT
If you would like some information from some of those Stage IV survivors you might visit the following website which is a discussion group and there are some amazing women there who are more than willing to share their experiences as Stage IV Survivors.	FACT
Your Mothers Oncologist remains the best source of information regarding her particular case.	FACT
Check out this website though if you have time: bcsupport.org.	FACT
I thought you answered her question very wellï¿½ and I read most all of your replies which are great.	OPINION
You are very knowledgable and helpful to this board.	OPINION
But I cannot help but askï¿½	FACT
why did I get kicked off this board when I gave one woman a website to go too?	FACT
She had a very aggressive type of breast cancerï¿½ the type I have which is ``"Her2/neu"''.	EXPERIENCE
She was in a panic and very upset and was getting no replies.	EXPERIENCE
( And believe me when your 1st diagnosis with because...its urgent that someone answer you as soon as possible because you are scared to death! )	EXPERIENCE
So I tried to help her and replied the best I can because I know quite a bit about Her2 b.c. .	EXPERIENCE
And ``"one"'' part of my reply to her was a message board that is JUST for ``"Her2/neu"''.	EXPERIENCE
The board I told her about is up to date on everything Her2 related.	EXPERIENCE
They have all the clinical trials...can direct you to the best doctors that understand this type of cancer and every new treatment that is out to fight it.	EXPERIENCE
So I very nicely said please check out this website and the woman here will be very supportive and can answer all your questions about Her2.	EXPERIENCE
She was very apperciative and has recieved so much help once she went to the Her2 board I told her about.	EXPERIENCE
But the minute I did that I immediately got a PM from MedHelp telling me I was no longer to post here and they removed my user name.	EXPERIENCE
( Something to that affect).	EXPERIENCE
They did not even give me a chance.	EXPERIENCE
Here I was spending my valuable time trying to help these scared woman since i have been in their shoes ...	EXPERIENCE
and I get kicked off the board for being NICE.	EXPERIENCE
( what is up with that? )	OPINION
They could at least warn a person NICELY and say the rules of the board and not to post OTHER websites or you will be expelled premanetly.	OPINION
But no...they ``"were not"'' nice about it at all.	EXPERIENCE
I even wrote them back to explain the same thing i am tell you but they did NOT care and rather I just go away.	EXPERIENCE
There are NOT very many people here to answer questions ...	FACT
so why they would chase someone like me away that is honestly trying to help someone is beyond me.	OPINION
( I do not post or reply often now since they did that).	FACT
I waited about a month and decided to sign up under another name in order to help these poor woman that need answers.	EXPERIENCE
But i am still upset the way I was treated.	EXPERIENCE
i have been on a lot of message boards over the last 25 years and i have never been treated like that.	EXPERIENCE
You just posted another website in order to help this person that was very distressed and upset which I think was VERY KIND of you and approperiate considering her circumstances.	OPINION
So i am just curious why they were so quick to kick me off even when I APOLOGIZED for giving this girl the name of a website?	OPINION
I was ``"not"'' spamming the board with websites...and that is how I was treated for offering ONE girl one website for a very aggressive type of cancer.	EXPERIENCE
I just do not get it.	FACT
( Had I known it was breaking a RULE or something...I would of gladly PMd her the website )	FACT
They did not kick you off this board for handing out another website for this person?	FACT
Just me.	NOT_LABELED
I see nothing wrong with someone helping another.	OPINION
I will probably get kicked off for this one too...just watch.	OPINION
If this board has rulesï¿½everyone should have to follow themï¿½	FACT
why did they just single me out?	OPINION
i am usually one 3 boards to help others...and occasionally someone will post a special board that is only for stage IV, or Metsters, Her2/neu, lung cancer, etc...and no one gets kicked of any of those board for trying to direct someone to find help for their situation.	EXPERIENCE
Its always bothered me that Medhelp jumped on me like that.	OPINION
I was brand new here and trying to help all the newly diagnosis...so much for that.	EXPERIENCE
has not medhelp heard of warnings or telling someone that is not allowed verses just KICK them off the board for good.	OPINION
Sorry...ticks me off.	OPINION
That was not fair.	OPINION
i am WAS a stage IIIA, Her2/neu , 3+++ survivor which was just diagnosis stage IV last week.	EXPERIENCE
My time is valuable to meï¿½important.	OPINION
I just LIKE to HELP peopleï¿½ not because problems or hurt anyone.	OPINION
I just did not like that way I was treated.	OPINION
Now I see you post a website and that is ok...but its not for me.	OPINION
Medhelp should only have one set of rules...not a double standard.	OPINION
And believe me...this post is with ALL DUE RESPECT for you.	OPINION
You do good work here!: )	OPINION
I guess i have been holding this in a long time and life is SHORT...well it will be for meï¿½so I wanted to get this out.	OPINION
They can always delete this and kick me off again.	FACT
Whatever works for them.	FACT
Its no loss to me if they kick me off again...only to the people posting here that lose.	FACT
Keep up the ``"great"'' work Japdip ...	OPINION
your are fast to respond to everyones questions and that alone is very important.	OPINION
When diagnosis with because...the answers cannot come fast enough.	FACT
Waiting is the hardest part for us.	NOT_LABELED
Peace ...	NOT_LABELED
take care.	NOT_LABELED
Keep up the good work.	NOT_LABELED

I am so sorry you got another diagnosis of cancer.	OPINION
I am sending prayers your way that you get the correct treatment and that you recover again.	OPINION
And i am sorry you have had a tough time posting.	OPINION
I value your posts and I believe other women do as well.	OPINION
I ran into the same issue and I was fortunate to get a moderator who allowed me to explain why I post about BRCA and use a certain website for women to get more information.	EXPERIENCE
I was given an opportunity to share all of the research available there and they saw that it was of value to the people who visit medhelp.	EXPERIENCE
Apparently it is against their terms of service, something about competing sites.	FACT
I do understand why you would offer that website to someone desperate for information and I know your heart is in the right place.	OPINION
We advocate for women with breast cancer.	FACT
We try to help however we can.	FACT
Even if it is just a cyber hug.	FACT
( You may want to check into the PARP inhibitor studies going on right now for metastatic breast cancer).	OPINION
My thoughts and prayers are with you.	NOT_LABELED
Best wishes.	NOT_LABELED
Just wanted to pipe in and say I am so glad you are active on this Web site and that I have gotten gotten a lot out of your posts!	OPINION
( I know from personal experience that the rules are applied very unevenly )	OPINION
I am sorry that you are now in Stage 4.	OPINION
My thoughts and prayers are with you.	NOT_LABELED

EXPERIENCE
so keep positive xx.	OPINION
i am a 31 year old stage 4 breast cancer patient, currently in chemotherapy.	EXPERIENCE
i have had severe postoperative pain from the mastectomy I had almost three years ago which my doctor has been treating with a steadily escalating series of opiate drugs: vicodin, then norco, then oxycodone ...	EXPERIENCE
now she wants me to start the Fentanyl patch, and i am a little scared of it.	EXPERIENCE
It seems so serious (like something you only take if you are...yknowï¿½close to death! Which i am not! )	EXPERIENCE
And it scares me that so many people seem to become so addicted to it, and i am scared that Ill be too tired to be responsible, raise my three year old son, etc ...	OPINION
My doctor answered all the questions I asked of course but I have to admit I did not press too hard because I did not want her to think I was afraid of becoming an addict ...	EXPERIENCE
I mean, I still need help with this ****amn pain in my (ex) breast ...	FACT
it just seems like once I start this patch, there is no going back!	OPINION
Does anybody have any positive experience with the Fentanyl patch?	FACT
Did anybody use it for pain and then...get off of it one day?	FACT
Did it keep you from normal day-to-day responsibilities?	FACT
i am just a little nervous.	EXPERIENCE
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
absolutly DO NOT TAKE FENTYNAL PATCHES!	OPINION
i am 36 years old and i had breast cancer to they gave me fentynal.	EXPERIENCE
i regret ever taking it it has ruined my life!	EXPERIENCE
Jessie: What happened, if you do not mind my asking?	FACT
Did you become addicted to the fentanyl?	FACT
Would something else have been better for the postop marijuana pain?	FACT
I hope your cancer is in remission, by the way--- this all *****.	OPINION
i am scared of pain, scared of my cancer, scared of being too involved with pain medicines to be a good mom ...	EXPERIENCE
i am scared of a lot these days ...	EXPERIENCE
Emily.	NOT_LABELED
DO NOT TAKE!	OPINION
This drug is really only meant for the terminally ill!	FACT
Its the most horrible pain medicine to come off of.	OPINION
I was not addicted to it and had no idea I was going on the strongest pain medicine in the world.	EXPERIENCE
It is 100x stronger than morphine and 50 x stronger than herion.	FACT
It causes all kinds of side effects.	FACT
I had a friend on it for 3 weeks and she wanted to die when she was tapering off of it.	EXPERIENCE
This drug is hell and is not worth it.	OPINION
Stay away!	OPINION
You will thank me!	OPINION
I had to learn the HARD way!	EXPERIENCE
Wowï¿½so sorry to hear all this.	NOT_LABELED
I am tapering off Oxycodones and even though it has been tough, I am sticking to my schedule and doing well.	EXPERIENCE
I would definitely do all the research you can on your own before taking anything like this for pain.	OPINION
Just like jessie and shellbell said, these drugs can and will ruin your life.	OPINION
I do not think Doctors really understand how easily a person can go from taking these medicines as prescribed to getting way out of control with them.	OPINION
A few years ago, a friend of my brothers was given Fentanyl patches for his back after a botched surgery.	EXPERIENCE
At the time, he was only 32 ...	EXPERIENCE
Within a few months, he was taken off them and started into withdrawal....and within a couple days after that, he was in Intensive Care at the Hospital....yep ...	EXPERIENCE
he almost died from w/d.	EXPERIENCE
They had to put him back on it and tried to taper him off them slowly....but he ended up getting so sick and desperate, he started seeking out street drugs.	EXPERIENCE
He lost his job, his wife left and took the kids, he lost his home and vehicle ...	EXPERIENCE
everything.	NOT_LABELED
This only took less than a year because of his need for the drugs....and he ultimately committed suicide....	EXPERIENCE
it was a tough loss for everyone.	EXPERIENCE
It is devastating what these types of medicines can do.	OPINION
I have read so many stories that reflect how I was about the medicines.	EXPERIENCE
I was ``"dumb"'' about them and never really did any real research on how they work or what they do....once I did discover this, I knew I had to get off them ...	EXPERIENCE
but fear kept me from trying.	EXPERIENCE
It was not until a few months ago that I really started talking to my Doctor about wanting to get off them and now I am really glad I did....	EXPERIENCE
I hope we caught it before it had a chance to get totally out of control...but I will say it was becomming a real problem.	EXPERIENCE
I hope you are able to find something for your pain....nothing worse than hurting all the time.	OPINION
God Bless.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, i am sorry to hear you are having such a pain problem.	OPINION
My concern about the fentanyl patches is that the side effects can continue to increase even though the pain relief effect has begun to diminish.	OPINION
This can lead to oversedation or in some cases even death, esp.	FACT
if the patient then takes additional analgesics to try to obtain adequate pain relief ...	FACT
My suggestion would be for you to enroll in a pain clinc, if you have not already done so, so that your pain can be closely monitored and managed by a doctor who is a specialist in this area of medicine.	OPINION
Besr wishes ...	NOT_LABELED
i also would not start with them.	EXPERIENCE
I once used fentanyl patchen when I was in so much pain from a condition called osteonecrosis where my femur was dying, and it was so painful that 8-10 oxycodone did not do the trick.	EXPERIENCE
the fentanyl was perfect, and after starting it I was able to walk again normally and a few weeks later the condition healed/resolved itself.	EXPERIENCE
( of course you will never know unless you are not on the drug so instead of changing the patch every three days I kept it on for 4 to wait for the pain to come back and then one day it no longer did )	EXPERIENCE
It was horrible coming off it, and when I told the oncologists nurse she told me that was ridiculous and she has never heard of anyone having withdrawels from it, even people who took much higher dose.	EXPERIENCE
I guess they all died and therefore had to not deal with withdrawal.	OPINION
Anyway, I took hydrocodone to do so.	EXPERIENCE
Yes, it is incredible for pain but I did no like the effect it has on me spirit wise; I felt depressed on it.	EXPERIENCE
I have since heard that drugs like oxycodone and vicodin are much more abused than fentanyl for just that reason.	EXPERIENCE
I do not think it is a feel good drug but incredibly powerful otherwise.	OPINION
No, I would not either.	NOT_LABELED

Hi, I suggest you go to a pain management group.	OPINION
There are lots of options.	FACT
My wife was stage 4 and tried all options.	EXPERIENCE
She was not able to handle any pain medicine except for darvicet.	EXPERIENCE
My rub down and long car rides were her main source of relief.	EXPERIENCE
Please see an expert on pain management.	OPINION
No drug is bad if it keep you from having pain.	OPINION
All my best.	NOT_LABELED

Wow.Im sorry to see all the misinformation on this thread about the fentanyl patch.	OPINION
Yes, it is a very strong pain medication, but that is why it is dosed in MICROgrams instead of MILLIgrams.	FACT
That is a huge difference.	OPINION
It is no more or less ``"addicting"'' than any other narcotic pain medication.	FACT
It does not matter if you use the fentanyl patch, hydrocodone, oxycodone or morphine.	FACT
If you take any of these drugs on a regular basis your body will become physically dependent upon it.	FACT
If you do not taper off slowly, you will experience withdrawal symptoms.	FACT
The presence of withdrawal does not mean the patient is an addict.	FACT
Addiction is a totally different problem involving abuse and overuse of a particular substance.	FACT
The fentanyl patch comes in many doses from 12.5 mcg (micrograms) per hour to 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 mcg.	FACT
The 25 mcg/ hour patch is equal to about 8 norco tablets a day, yet most people do not think twice about swallowing that much hydrocodone.	FACT
The fentanyl patch is prescribed for many kinds of marijuana pain, not just for those who have a terminal condition.	FACT
Please do not live your life in pain if you do not have to.	OPINION
Fentanyl, like any other opiate pain medication, is just a tool to help with pain.	FACT
Yes, it can be misused and abused, but so can any other opiate.	OPINION
If you work with your doctor and taper off when you no longer need it, you will not have to worry about withdrawal.	OPINION
Unless you have an underlying medical condition like a cardio-pulmonary problem, withdrawal will not kill you.	FACT
The biggest danger is from dehydration in people who suddenly discontinue opiate therapy and cannot cope with the vomiting and/or diarrhea.	FACT
Jaybay says: Wow.Im sorry to see all the misinformation on this thread about the fentanyl patch	FACT
Jaybay, you cannot call an opinion coming from personal experience sorry misinformation.	OPINION
your comment makes me pretty sure that you have never used a fentanyl patch?	FACT
Not 100 inserts, or books, or doctors and/or nurses advice on fentanyl comes even close to the value of reporting from personal experience, and I am impressed that pretty much all of us who have used fentanyl, or had a friend whose experience they are familiar with, has stringly advised against the drug, unless nothing else controls the pain.	OPINION
and fentanyl is not nearly as abused as other narcotics, so it is not the same as all the others, because it is not a feel good drug.	OPINION
Katrin.	NOT_LABELED
As I mentioned in my post above, fentanyl patches pose serious risks.	FACT
And it does not have to be misused or abused to be dangerous!	FACT
There are problems inherent in this delivery system for the medication.	FACT
At least two patients in our practice died while using them, as did one of my neighbors.	EXPERIENCE
The mother of another patient . suffered life-threatening respriatory depression, but was saved because her family got her to the hospital just in time.	EXPERIENCE
Here is a quote from an article about this problem, and a link to that article: ``"Since the Duragesic patch was first introduced by Johnson & Johnson in 1994, there have been a number of reported problems with fentanyl pain patches due to manufacturing issues.	FACT
At least seven different recalls of fentanyl patch systems have been issued by Johnson & Johnson and companies manufacturing generic versions of the patch, raising questions about whether the powerful painkiller can be safely made.	FACT
Hundreds of fentanyl pain patch overdose deaths have been associated with different versions of the patch, and dozens of fentanyl patch wrongful death lawsuits have been filed against the various manufacturers.	FACT
-URL-If you do not respect this article (because it is from a law Web site, just search the terms ``"fentanyl patch recalls"'' and ``"fentanyl patch side effects"'' and you will find many, many other references.	FACT

Thank you, baby, for this very objective post, and which complements the other posts derived from personal experience of people who have used the patch, and which is what eliandbasilsmom asked for.	FACT
Both, providing objective information, preferably with a link attached, and personal experience are what makes a forum like this so valuable to those who want to know something real.	OPINION
eliandbasilsmom asks: Does anybody have any positive experience with the Fentanyl patch?	FACT
Did anybody use it for pain and thenï¿½ get off of it one day?	FACT
Did it keep you from normal day-to-day responsibilities?	FACT
i am just a little nervous.	EXPERIENCE

I have been on the fentanyl patch for a year now - I have not had one problem with it!	EXPERIENCE
My pain is caused from Stage 4 BC with metastases to the bones and lungs.	EXPERIENCE
I am still using the patch - 175 mcgs every 3 days plus oxycodone - 6 to 8 a day plus doing the chemotherapy (chemotherapy for 3 years).	EXPERIENCE
I have not had any side effects and am pleased with how the patch is working!!	EXPERIENCE
I have been on varying doses over the Fentanyl patch for 3+ years & am currently trying to slowly taper down.	EXPERIENCE
i have tried this a few times before & EVERY time the withdrawals are so severe that I end up hospitalized & once even on life support.	EXPERIENCE
This time has been absolute hell & I STRONGLY urge that NO ONE uses this DRUG!!!	EXPERIENCE
I was not told by my doctor when it was prescribed how bad it was & I could not find any information online.	EXPERIENCE
Within a week of starting it I could feel the difference & everyone around me could see differences in me.	EXPERIENCE
I HAVE NEVER ABUSED THE DRUG, take it EXACTLY as prescribed & still have a dependence to them.	EXPERIENCE
Id LOVE to come off them, but at this time am pregnant & to try & come off now is pretty much a death sentence for both of us.	EXPERIENCE
I have been pregnant before on this horrible drug & did carry to term.	EXPERIENCE
She went through 2 weeks in the NICU with withdrawals which were the HARDEST 2 weeks of my life.	EXPERIENCE
She is a happy & healthy above average 2 year old who loves everything.	EXPERIENCE
I pray every night that this child I am carrying is healthy & pray that he will do ok.	FACT
i am withdrawaling pretty bad right now due to a miscalculation by my doctor so right now I can SAFELY tell you that NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU WILL BECOME ACCUSTOM TO THESE HORRID PATCHES & WILL GO THROUGH WITHDRAWALS.	EXPERIENCE
I do not want to see anyone suffer this if I can prevent it so PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!!!	OPINION
I am so sorry to hear what you and your daughter have gone through, and what you are now going through with your current pregnacy!	OPINION
Thank you for sharing your experience, which may be taken into consideration by others.	OPINION
