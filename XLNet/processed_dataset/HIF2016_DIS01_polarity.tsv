hi, my doctor has come to the conclusion i have IBS after not showing any signs of chrons in a colonoscopy test.	NEGATIVE
I have every symptom of chrons however: Ab pain, bowel changes, bloating, pain, have had red eyes, sore on leg that change color when fading, mouth ulcers, etc	NEGATIVE
my question is has anyone been diagnosed with chrons after having a clear colonoscpy?	NEUTRAL
Sorry madam but I was diagnosed with it after my bloodwork, colonoscopy and biopsies came back positive.	NEUTRAL
Most people I have talked to that have Chrons also had the positive colonoscopys which sealed the deal.	NEUTRAL
Sorry.	NOT_LABELED
It is possible you have Crohns in the small intestine, which will not show on a colonoscopy, as this only looks at the large intestine (colon).	NEUTRAL
An upper endoscopy (to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine) is another test to rule out Crohns as biopsies can be taken of the tissue during the procedure.	NEUTRAL
Crohns often starts around the terminal ileum (next to the appendix) and can progress to the whole gastrointestinal tract (mouth to anus), as mine has done.	NEUTRAL
A barium swallow through is another test to see any problems in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but this is purely imaging, and biopsies cannot not be taken.	NEUTRAL
As far as I understand, the only conclusive proof of Crohns is biopsy of affected tissue, looked at by a pathologist.	NEUTRAL
IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion - after all available tests are completed and found negative for Crohns or Ulcerative Colitis.	NEUTRAL
It is not an IBD auto-immune disease and in my opinion, a lazy diagnosis by doctors who cannot be bothered to do proper evaluations.	NEGATIVE
Have you been tested for coeliac disease, as this can have similar symptoms to IBD?	NEUTRAL
Liz.	NOT_LABELED
I had something simular happen.	NEUTRAL
I had surgery in August to remove a mass in my small intestine, in the terminal ileum and they biopsy said high probability of Crohns.	NEGATIVE
However, when I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy 5 months later, it showed inflamation.	NEGATIVE
and ulcers throughout my small intestine but this time negative on the Crohns.	NEGATIVE
I do not really understand.	NEGATIVE
The doctor said I could still have it but been in remission during that time.	NEUTRAL
That makes no sense to me.	NEGATIVE
So we still do not know if I have it or not.	NEUTRAL
i have had biopsy that said yes and one that said no, I guess.	NEUTRAL
It just does not make sense to me.	NEGATIVE
Still, the prescription is the same whether I have it or not, steriods to clear up the ulcers and inflamation.	NEUTRAL
i am taking Entocort and Nexium.	NEUTRAL
The doctor told me as long as i am still feeling pretty good by this Summer then will not need to see him again unless I get symptoms again.	POSITIVE
He told me that doctors are reluctant to diagnose Crohns unless they know definitely it is Crohns because of insurance reasons.	NEGATIVE
I guess I can understand that.	NEUTRAL
Still, Id like to know if I have Crohns or if it is something else, what is it?	NEUTRAL
You know?	NOT_LABELED
I hope you get a diagnosis soon.	POSITIVE
I can understand your frustration.	NEGATIVE
I wish you well.	POSITIVE
Take care.	NOT_LABELED
thankyou both for your informative replies ...	POSITIVE
I have heard of people who have chrons in the small intestines ...	NEUTRAL
however when i asked my doctor whether or not this could be a possibility, he said if i had chrons it more than likely would have shown up in the bowel/colon and did not want to talk any further.	NEUTRAL
i feel very frustrated as i have looked into many chrons symptoms from people with chrons and have been through everything they have ..	NEGATIVE
i was overwhelmed to finally find someone else going through what i have ...	NOT_LABELED
i share your opinion of IBS being a lazy diognosis from a doctor ...	NEGATIVE
i just do not think you can be as sick as i have been and it be that ...	NEGATIVE
and do you have to be having an attack of chrons for the colonoscopy/ endoscopy to pick up a positive result ...	NEUTRAL
or can it be picked up when you are not showing any symptoms?	NEUTRAL
... .sounds like Aprils question!	NEUTRAL
anyway, is not it just great when you get better..	POSITIVE
have had 5 weeks of hell and am now feeling normal again!	POSITIVE
how are you girls feeling?	NEUTRAL
good to talk ...	POSITIVE

You can have Crohns Disease anywhere in your digestive tract, from your lips to your anus.	NEUTRAL
It is most common in the colon, but it is not exclusive.	NEUTRAL
Think of it as a mean thing living inside of you that can either attack one place or spread to another place, or MOVE to another.	NEGATIVE

NEGATIVE
I am in a similar situation and trying to get a second opinion at this point.	NEUTRAL

it all adds to the stress your body is under while trying to fend off the attack on our immune systems, therefore you could be susceptible to further outbreaks.	NEGATIVE

Hey guys, if you have any questions that still need answers please post a new question so we can help you out.	POSITIVE
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
Hi Guys, I see this is a really old thread, but I want to share the information I have on this matter as it s a top very close to my heart and I want to help anyone I can who is also struggling with these health issues ...	POSITIVE
I have struggled with IBS-C since I was a little girl, and contracted HSV2 about 5 years ago.	NEUTRAL
I have dealt with weekly, if not daily, herpes outbreaks since my contracting it.	NEGATIVE
I found when my gut acted up (pain, distention, bloating, constipation etc), I would get an outbreak within hours.	NEGATIVE
Even taking Valtex at 1G per day did not stop it.	NEGATIVE
I work out regularly, eat a whole foods diet and have seen a therapist regularly to manage stress.	NEUTRAL
Nothing helped, if anything it got worse over the years.	NEGATIVE
I have only recently, in the past year, found out that the underlying because of IBS is often a condition called SIBO (small intestinal bacteria overgrowth).	NEUTRAL
This is when bacteria that is only meant to be in the large intestine makes its way up in to the small intestine.	NEUTRAL
This can because damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine as well as create gas, blasting, constipation, diarrhea, food intolerances, marijuana fatigue etc.	NEUTRAL
The reason this happens is due to low stomach acid, pancreatic exocrine function, and/or malfunctioning ileocecal valve.Bascially stress from emotions, food, drugs (recreational or pharma) all contribute to this problem.	NEUTRAL
The overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to a lot of endotoxins (waste) from the bacteria.	NEUTRAL
This waste damages the nerves surrounding in the gut leading to issues with motility (constipation, diarrhea), and weakens the immune system.	NEUTRAL
This is what lead to an opportunity for the herpes virus to express itself in me regularly.	NEGATIVE
It took me years to find this out.	NEGATIVE
I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I do not.	POSITIVE
To heal SIBO, you need to have a doctor or nutritionist supervise and provide a healing protocol via a diet called Low FODMAP"'', and one, to several rounds of either pharmaceutical or herbal antibiotics to rebalance the microbiome.	NEUTRAL
The low FODMAPs diet will reduce inflammation and help to starve the bacteria.	POSITIVE
Most find a huge relief in symptoms from cutting out high FODMAP foods alone, but that is only half the battle.	POSITIVE
You need the anti-microbials and re-inocculation.	NEUTRAL
Testing for SIBO is key.	NEUTRAL
You can do so through a Naturopath or Nutritionist.	NEUTRAL
Its important to know you have it for sure.	NEUTRAL
Keep in mind, studies are now proving that SIBO is the underlying case of IBS, and can be cured with patience and diligence.	NEUTRAL
So, the link between IBS and herpes is real.	NEUTRAL
IBS/SIBO severely weakens the immune system and creates the space of the virus to wreak havoc.	NEUTRAL
When you get the gut micrbiome under control, the virus will not have the same opportunities to express itself.	POSITIVE
I really hope this helps many of you struggling with this.	POSITIVE
I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this Id say; please take self-judgement out of the mix.	NEUTRAL
I know, easier said than done but at the end of the day it is just a virus.	POSITIVE
It does not define us.	NOT_LABELED
Self-judgment will only lead to more stress and we do not need more of that.	NEGATIVE
And there is someone out there that will fully accept you the way you are.	POSITIVE
I promise you that.	NEUTRAL
Stay positive, full of optimism and self-love and do not settle.	POSITIVE
You can heal these issues.	POSITIVE
xo.	NOT_LABELED

I have had Ulcerative Colitis since I was 18 , 12 years now, and have been through every medication available.	NEUTRAL
Two weeks ago I had the most severe back pain ever and did not want to go to my regular doctor for pain medication.	NEGATIVE
There had to be something better than being on pain medication.	NEGATIVE
I was told by several friends to see a chiroprator.	NEUTRAL
THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!	POSITIVE
I have been seeing a chiropractor for the last 3 weeks for my lower back pain, but I have noticed tremendous relief with my ulcerative colitis which was unexpected.	POSITIVE
I had always had discomfort in my lower back especially on my right side, like a pinched nerve feeling which made it very difficult to sleep on that side or even sit.	NEGATIVE
The pain I felt prior to going to the chiropractor was that same pinched nerve feeling put right in the middle of my lower back which effected both sides of my body.	NEGATIVE
After the x-rays my chiropractor took, I was shocked!	POSITIVE
There was a twist in my lower back that veered to the right (where all the pain of my colitis is located!	NEUTRAL
) I have been pain free since my adjustments and am on a 10 week fix plan.	POSITIVE
Everything in our body is linked to our spine, that is where all our nerves control other parts of our body.	NEUTRAL
I never would have put two and two together, but it has brought tremendous relief to me that I could never have imagined!	POSITIVE
Remember: You have nothing to lose by going to the chiropractor first.	POSITIVE
Surgeries and Pain medicines will stay with you for a lifetime!	NEUTRAL
Those should be your VERY LAST options!	NEGATIVE
I have had the disease for two years now and I have only had about 10 days where I have not had pain in my back legs knees shoulders and my abdomen without taking any medicines.	NEGATIVE
I was taking 16 pills a day to clam down the back pain along with my burning sensation in my abdomen.	NEGATIVE
Finally I took Tramodol and that saved my life.	POSITIVE
If I do not take it when I get up the pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and knees kills me.	NEGATIVE
I work in surgery and I have to walk and stand on really hard floors so that does not help at all.	NEGATIVE
I hate waking up in the morning with a burning sensation in my abdomen and the pain and weakness I occur when I sleep for more than 5 hours at a time.	NEGATIVE
I went to a chiropractor and he really really screwed up my back.	NEGATIVE
He hurt me more than I could imagine.	NEGATIVE

I hate it.	NEGATIVE
My Crohns doctor is best friends with my husband and he still cannot help me.	NEGATIVE
I think its a wicked disease that no one really understands and if you do not have it you do not really understand the pain that is involved with crohns.	NEGATIVE
I have to live on Tramodol or else i am in constant pain.	NEGATIVE
I have to go off the tramodol for periods of times so I do not get addicted to it.	NEGATIVE

take a B-100 capsule with each meal.	NEUTRAL
take 2 of those 500 mg odor controlled garlic capsules with each meal if you can which comes out to some 6 capsules daily.	NEUTRAL

B6 and B12 and folate deficiency equals SHRUNKEN BRAIN which means you have lost Millions of Neurons...... ...	NEUTRAL
You are Deficient in B-vitamins, Magnesium, vitamin K2, VITAMIN C because of the daily diahrea!	NEGATIVE
TO fix the Neurons in the colon, you must take a lot of these nutrients to counteract the effect of the diahrea so DO NOT DRINK caffeine or Alcohol during this period because these are diuretics and make you urinate a lot so you urinate the micronutrients out, and YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DIAHREA DEPLETING your body of them.	NEUTRAL
THE key to fixing these nerves is taking a bunch of those micronrutrients in my previous post JUST DO NOT take more than 400 mg of magnesium, any more than that and it will become a Laxative.	NEUTRAL

Hi there - not sure if I had Asacol, had so many different drugs over the past 38 years, as well as 30+ years of steroids - a no no now, but that was the only drug available to bring a flare into remission in those days.	POSITIVE
IBD drugs have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, and although I am very stable on methotrexate there are some much newer drugs, anti-TNF biologic therapies, like Humira, Cimzia, Tysabril and Infliximab which gives one hope for the future.I do not know where you live, but believe these drugs are now available in the US but are still being trialed in the UK.	NEUTRAL
My gastro said he has never known anyone tolerate methotrexate for 7 years without serious liver side effects, but guess I have always confounded general medical issues - did not ``"present"'' normally with Crohns - no pain, just severe diarrhea and weight loss, and when I got breast cancer 5 years ago, I had no palpable lump.	NEGATIVE
It was found on a regular 3 yrly mammo, which is all we get here in England with our socialized health service.	NEUTRAL
If I had known what I know now, I would have had private mammos in the intervening years, and perhaps the cancer would not have spread to my lymph nodes.	NEGATIVE

My Oncologist prescribed a small daily dose of dexamethasone (a steroid) and got the hospital to send me a huge carton of Fortijuice - a vitamin and mineral juice type drink - 9 different flavors, all yucky, but I had to have some nourishment to stay alive.	NEUTRAL
Each carton had 300 cals and I had to sip 3 cartons a day.	NEUTRAL
Did the trick!	NOT_LABELED

These drinks stopped me from becoming dehydrated.	POSITIVE
I did lose some 28 lbs during the 4 months of FEC chemotherapy, but have put it back on thankfully and am steady at 112 lbs.	POSITIVE

I feel good on this forum being able to talk about my disease without feeling like i am complaining.	POSITIVE

Not sure which medicines you want advice on - I take, on rising, one codeine phosphate (helps with the lower abdomen pain), one imodium, to slow down the motility, one folic acid (necessary when taking methotrexate) and inject myself with 12.5mg of methotrexate weekly.	NEUTRAL
( I take other medicines for breast cancer and osteopenia).	NEUTRAL
Mtx can be very toxic to the liver especially, but I have monthly blood tests and am tolerating it well.	POSITIVE

Seeing GP 28th May for referral to a new Oncologist as mine retired last year.	NEUTRAL
You are right to steer clear of steroids.	POSITIVE
When I was diagnosis in 1970, the dark ages as far as Crohns was concerned, the only medication to bring a flare into remission was prednisone, and the thinking then was it would keep one in remission, which has now been proven to be inaccurate.	NEGATIVE
I was on steroids, varying amounts, for 30 years and this has played havoc with my bone density, which is classed osteopenic after various DEXA scans.	NEGATIVE
I take alendronic acid (a bisphosphonate) weekly, and daily Calcichew/Vit.D to strengthen my bones and prevent further loss.	NEUTRAL
Nobody told me all those years ago that steroids did this, perhaps they did not know, but even if they had, there was no alternative to steroids.	NEGATIVE
Happily, there are so many new drugs now for Crohns, it seems to be a question of trial and error to find one that keeps you in remission.	POSITIVE
Guess I discovered the holy grail when I found mtx on the internet and badgered my then gastro to prescribe it off license.	POSITIVE
It is still not licensed in England for Crohns as the mfrs feel there are too few patients to make the licensing costs worthwhile.	NEGATIVE
Are you on an immuno-suppressant?	NEUTRAL
I remember some years ago when the Crohns & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) had a website where questions were answered foc by a retired gastroenterologist, Dr. Eugene May.	NEUTRAL

However, Dr. May did say that Crohns patients should always be on an immuno-suppressant (like mtx), because the disease is incurable.	NEGATIVE
I have not had a flare since taking mtx, except for a bad one when having FEC chemotherapy for breast cancer and had to stop the mtx.	POSITIVE

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis almost a year ago after having a bad attack after pizza one weekend that never went away.	NEGATIVE
It took about 3 months of extreme pain, biopsys, barium tests, and a colonoscopy to find out what I was sick with.	NEGATIVE
I spent 3 months off of work resting at home because I became so sick and malnourishment and too many trips to the bathroom to count.	NEGATIVE
The pain I experienced was horrible.	NEGATIVE
I would get bundled over with abdomal pain and just start crying in front of my customers due to the insane pain.	NEGATIVE

I am still throwing up a few days in a row in the mornings no matter what it is that I eat and It seems that when I start to feel ill it last about a week.	NEGATIVE
Everyday is a different story and that is frustrating in itself.	NEGATIVE
This has taken a toll on my normal cheery self and the steroids give me horrible side effects including: depression, insomnia, weight gain, sweats, nausea, etc.	NEGATIVE
The depression is the worst, I feel very angry that at 24 years old I have been handed this card and I am not able to live the life of a normal 25 year old right now.	NEGATIVE

He has been on a few different medications and all seem to do NOTHING.	NEGATIVE
He has now been throwing for the last 2 days, trying to only eat what the Dr. told him (soup broth, ginger ale & crackers).	NEGATIVE
The interesting thing is he is not throwing up any food, its all acid & the last 2 days its been just about every 2 hours.	NEGATIVE
he's taking 6mp right now & refuses to take the nausea medicines because it gives him a horrible migraine.	NEGATIVE
Is there something the Dr. is missing, not giving him, or any other medications out there that work better in these cases?	NEUTRAL
If so I would greatly appreciate some advice.	POSITIVE
Thank You!	NOT_LABELED
Hi All, I thought I would let some people know what my experiences were.	NEUTRAL
I have Ulcerative colitis, and really from the start (3 - 4 years) i have had constant morning nausea.	NEUTRAL
To be 100% honest, I get nausea and dry reaching / vommiting, but it is almost always when I get up, and before I eat, normally in the shower i have 5 - 10 minutes of dry reaching.	NEGATIVE
It is not effected by bowel movements, i.e I have not gone to the toilet or even after I still get it.	NEUTRAL
I changed my medicines from salfa to mesaline and that made a 10% difference, certainly not signifant but enough to offer a little relief.	POSITIVE
I have not found a solution to preventing something like this, and again being honest its something that I have almost gotten used to, its not something that I like to have to go through every morning, nor is it nice for my partner to listen to, but I certainly am getting used to it, and not eating before makes it a little easier, if i was to have breakfast then be sick, i would not be able to handle it, so I normally do not eat breakfast.	NEUTRAL
Sorry its not a solution, rather another perspective.	NEUTRAL
Just wondering if ant fellow crohnies out there have had kidney trouble.	NEUTRAL

The only thing that has seemed to help was Ciprofloxacn, which then stopped working after a time and now works again in combination with Tindamax.	POSITIVE
My surgeon would prefer me not to be continuously on two antibiotics and I would certainly prefer that too, but the alternative is not fun, cramping, constant bathroom visits and the worst is leakage at night.	NEGATIVE
Does ANYONE have any remedies, natural therapies, a different medication to suggest, really anything?	NEUTRAL
I have also tried a course of probiotics while not taking medication and my pouch just continued to get worse.	NEGATIVE

i have had my pouch for 15 years and definitely the first year or so was tough but I eventually got into the habit of eating bulking foods (oatmeal, marshmallows, apple sauce, meats, eggs) and avoided heavy fiber foods and spices.	NEUTRAL
Eventually i have been able to eat anything but occasionally if I have too much spicy or too much salads or sugar I run into problems.	NEGATIVE
I assume you take an anti-diarrheal?	NEUTRAL
Thank you for your response.	POSITIVE
Unfortunately, even when I had Ulcerative Colitis, diet never seemed to make a difference.	NEGATIVE
However, I do avoid spicy foods because they do bring pain.	NEGATIVE
As far as anti-diarrheals, I have tried Imodium, but it seemed to make me feel like I had a blockage or constipation, but maybe I was taking too many or something.	NEGATIVE

I was diagnosed with Chrons in 11/07.	NEUTRAL
The only reason I am at this point is that in June 07 I began having wicked arthritis in my entire body.	NEGATIVE
I could barely move, pick things up, etc.	NEGATIVE
After many doctor visits, appointments with numerous specialists (including an RA specialist, after taking many ugly medicines with bad side effects) I was sent to a gastrointestinal and diagnosed with Chrons Colitis.	NEUTRAL
He said that the arthritis is a direct side effect of the Chrons.	NEUTRAL
I only got my life back after a crazy regimine of steroids and Celebrex.	NEGATIVE
Now I am being weened off of the steroids (it is painful and the arthritis flares up every now and then) and am on Imuran and am bouncing back.	POSITIVE

I have had some trouble over the years with stiff joints in my hands, mostly in winter, but around four months ago I started getting real pain in my hands and fingers followed by them swelling, this then started in my feet and ankles, legs, knees, arms elbows and shoulders and seems to move from one place to the other on a 2-3 day basis, it sometimes even changes from being severe to the point of not being able to use my hands to just a slight pain and completely moved to, say a knee or a foot over night.	NEGATIVE
My only respite now is too many pain killers and complete rest, as soon as I work (I do not to anything too manual these days) or take exersize one or another, or several of my limbs will be extremely painfull or sore to touch very soon after.	NEGATIVE
The pain is not confined to my joints, in fact there is not always pain in the joint, more around it and in cases up my arm or leg, more like, and it changes, tendon or muscle pain.	NEGATIVE
Yesterday my ankle was swollen and painfull to move, enough to because me to limp and my calf muscle felt as though I had a severe cramp in it every time I put my foot to the floor.	NEGATIVE
The strangest thing is this continuing changing of the area that gives most pain.	NEUTRAL
I am coming to the end of my tether with this, my Doctors keep telling me its to do with the Crohns, we will have to do more tests etc.etc.	NEGATIVE
My Crohns has been very good as far as I am concerned for some time now, although I have recently had a pillcam which seems to reveal that the Crohns is active but there is nowhere to go medically, looking like the only option is more surgery.	NEUTRAL
If the surgery would get rid of the new symptoms while the Crohns stays at bay, great but I am now 54 and not keen on yet more surgery when I feel in myself that this is a separate issue from the Crohns.	NEGATIVE
There are apparently more than 70 kinds of arthuritis, is it possible that this has nothing to do with the Crohns and should be investigated on its own symptoms?	NEUTRAL
I find if you have Crohns any other ailment at all is lumped in with it, ``"Oh that is to do with your Crohns"'' is sometimes a very convenient answer.	NEUTRAL
Any help at all would be appreciated, if any one else experienced anything like this or any proffesionals out there have heard of similar symptoms please get in touch through this site or direct to *** @ **** Thanks.	NEUTRAL

Sometimes it is the joints but more often than not it is the area around the joints (from the RP).	NEUTRAL
In the last year i have had swelling/inflammations in my nose, ear, face, neck, elbow, wrists, arm, fingers and toes.	NEGATIVE
One day both of my ankles were totally swollen and I was confined to bed which is very difficult with UC.	NEGATIVE
Its become a running joke each day to see what part of my body is sore or inflamed as i am trying to see the humor in all of this to keep from crying.	NEGATIVE

I have also dealt with back pain for the last 20 years and have always dealt with it via chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio, swimming etc.	NEUTRAL
but in the last 6 months i have had some episodes that have been the most painful of my life and have only recently been told that the two are likely related.	NEGATIVE
i have been on Humira for 2 years, infliximab I reacted badly too, and colazide gives me diarhea, and the sulfasalizine type drugs just do bugger all.	NEGATIVE
I want to only to say I empathize with you all.	POSITIVE
To others we look like we are okay, it is hard for them to understand the excrutiating pain we can be in.	NEGATIVE

Wow.	NOT_LABELED
I read this discussion and it could have been parts of my own life!!!	NEUTRAL
I was diagnosed with crohns 17 years ago when I was 19.	NEUTRAL
Spent the first 12 years having the digestive issues most of you guys described, including about a foot of bowel removed (iliem area) when I was 28.	NEUTRAL
For the last 6 years it is been less digestive issues, though they are still there, and more joint issues.	NEGATIVE
I have 3 vertebrae in my lower back that a back doctor told me look like a 90 year old ditch diggers because of the amount of inflammation/arthritis affecting them.	NEGATIVE
My knees, wrists, feet, toes, hips...All can and will ache depending on the day/ moment.	NEGATIVE
I have plantar facitis (especially) - inflamed tendons on the bottom of my feet, supposed gout in my left big toe - but it is ALL inflammation of 1 type or another.	NEUTRAL
i am taking hydromorphcontin every day wondering if i am getting physically dependent on it, but not able to walk properly or ``"manage my life"'' if I do not take it.	NEGATIVE
ie . Too stiff & sore & in too much pain to do simple things like cook, clean, go to the playground with my son (6 years old).	NEGATIVE
I also have a spouse who tells me my pain is mostly ``"in my head"'' & I do not need the pain medicines.	NEGATIVE
I do not get a ``"high"'' from them, take them exactly as prescribed and have stopped taking them only to be unable to sleep & go from bed, straight to sofa in the morning because i am to stiff & sore & in pain to do anything.	NEGATIVE
i have met people with ``"regular"'' arthritis (reumatiod & osteo) and generally the people i have met say they suffer more from stiffnes & with RA deformaties but do not appear to have the ``"traveling"'' inflammation of the joints I do (as in one day my knees are worse, few days later it seems my wrists are worse, my back always hurts).	NEUTRAL
Has any one else run into this?	NEUTRAL
I believe I have a very high pain tolerance laughing out loud after crohns for this long i have only been on regular pain medicines for the last 4 years.	POSITIVE
With the gut pain we can get people with crohns develop a high pain tolerance I believe.	POSITIVE
i have tried humira but reacted to it.	NEGATIVE
I also tried remicade a few years ago but had to stop because I got really run down & sick & could not get healthly again.	NEGATIVE
My gastrio-doc is thinking of remicade again or referring me to a reumatiod arthritis doctor, waiting for blood work to come back.	NEUTRAL
In addition to humira (allerigic), remicade, i have been on pentasa, salofalk (especially?), entocort & prednisone, (so sick of cortisteroids), & immurane (got very very sick from).	NEGATIVE
Anyway not that I wish these problems on anyone but it is nice to hear about them & know a person is not the only one going through it, especially when (for me at least) the people closest to me really have no idea what it is like.	POSITIVE
Thanks for letting me ramble.	POSITIVE
Hi, I was diagnosed with crohns disease in 2003, I had one colon resection in 2006.	NEUTRAL
I am in pain everyday, and I too think that I am crazy, and would not ever wish this debilitating disease on no one.	NEGATIVE

( do not want to become addicted) tylenol nor tylenol PM works for me anymore.	NEGATIVE
I have Rheumatoid arthritis stemming from the crohns.	NEUTRAL
Sometime I do not even know what to say or how to describe my pain anymore, because it just seems as though people do not believe you, and I guess because I still have to get up and do what I have to do; cook, clean, wash, drive kids, which is dangerous because my legs sometimes lock up on me and I have to pull over until the pain goes away.	NEGATIVE
I feel for everyone on this panel and I understand the misery of Crohns, we are not CRAZY, just in constant PAIN.	NEGATIVE
Hi, I am back, (Nace1) my first post was June 7th 2010, where I spoke about having had Crohns for some 26/7 years , 3 operations, (bowel resections) and at date of that post 4 months of severe migrating joint pain.	NEGATIVE
So here we are 14 months later with an update: Many consultations later with both Gastro & Reumatologist, Reumo is baffled by what is going on as many tests show no degradation associated with arthritis but believes in my pain and has seen physical and photographic evidence of swellings	NEUTRAL
In summary thinks its connected to the Crohns, somehow?	NEUTRAL
Gastro is convinced the Crohns is under control and therefore joint & other areas with these symptoms are not connected?	NEUTRAL
so, not the Crohns?	NEUTRAL
So neither of them are taking any responsibility, they can't both be right unless it is something completely different?	NEUTRAL
I am so so frustrated, I am sure I could handle the pain and disability better if I new what it is and what to expect, I am now unable to work full time or plan anything as I do not know from one day to the next how I am going to be.	NEGATIVE
I do not know the answers, but it does help to speak with people who have an idea what I am going through, so thanks for that at least guys, actually I think mostly ladies on this forum, I feel for you all.	POSITIVE
Paul.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Yes, it is probably all related, because Crohns and arthritis are both auto-immune conditions, where the bodys immune system attacks the body itself.	NEUTRAL
I did it the other way round, i have had arthritis for many years, since my 30s (i am now 61) and I got Crohns at age 54.	NEUTRAL
It was blamed on the anti-inflammatory drugs I had been taking for years.	NEGATIVE
I have especially bad arthritis in my spine and cannot now take much in the way of anti-inflammatory, only 1 tab of naproxen a day, but it does take the edge off.	NEGATIVE
what is really good for joints is green-lipped mussel supplement, freely available.	POSITIVE
I got on to it because the vet gave one of our dogs some for hip arthritis and within a couple of days she was jumping round like a puppy, so I thought if it works for the dog, it is got to help me too!	POSITIVE
Give that a try, it does not seem to irritate the gut.	POSITIVE
Hey this i think is defiantly crohns related ...	NEUTRAL
i am a 30 year old female who was diagnosed with Crohns earlier this year & also diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis a few months ago.	NEUTRAL
i am in pain all the time & it *****, i know how it feels ...	NEGATIVE
I too also have to go see a Reumatologist for the Psoriatic Arthritis & i am taking Embrel Shots 2x a week for it because i have plaque masses on my hands, elbows, knees, back & the whole top of my right foot & those are all the places i also have joint pain too: (They itch all the time, they are red & swollen but i not only do i feel the pain on the outside of my skin, i feel it in my joints too.	NEGATIVE
Hi I have Crohns disease and have just started getting a lot of joint pain, mainly in my right hip, its so bad some times i am unable to weight bare on it, Any advice?	NEGATIVE
Well like the most of you i have been on this roller coaster for 18 years now with Colitis, my hips and knees were getting so sore I was having trouble trying to sleep.	NEGATIVE
After feeling my gastrointestinal was enjoying his work just a little too much and feeling embarrassed to go for appointments I switched to a new gastrointestinal who after five years has never given me a rectal exam in his office.	NEGATIVE
He put me on 300 mg of Celebrix/ day and after one month the only time my hips bother me is if I walk further than I should and yes definitely related to Chrons and Colitis.	POSITIVE
Now there are two different dosages depending on which Arthritis your gastrointestinal puts down you are being treated for, the milder sorry if that sounds insensitive only allows 200 mg for insurance purposes where the nastier form allows for 400 mg.	NEUTRAL
i am sorry I have not got the names I know one is Rumathoid but I think you should get the idea.	NEUTRAL
so my gastrointestinal gives me 300 mg because 200 would not do it.	NEUTRAL
Good Luck to you all and may God Bless.	POSITIVE
Rick.	NOT_LABELED
Trina is that what it is called green-lipped mussel supplement, from what I know Celebrex is better than Naproxin and does not bother me at all at 300 mg / day, my hips and knees have finally stopped bothering me.	POSITIVE
My Colitis has been contributed to my anti inflamatory Feldene 200 mg / day I was taking following three failed back surgeries.	NEUTRAL
Strange they gave me the good old reliable strong one and really messed me up.	NEGATIVE
Its funny our pets get better medicines than we do.	NEGATIVE
I just want to make sure of the name of the other, they will not give my wife the same as me so she still suffers, maybe it will work for her too Thank in advance.	NEGATIVE

I was diagnosed with UC 15 years ago that never went into remission and I had a colectomy with j-pouch surgery 13 years ago.	NEGATIVE
That took care of the intestinal issues, but I have had fatigue and joint/muscle aches all along the way and they have recently gotten worse.	NEGATIVE
The slightest exertion can leave me achy, weak, nauseous, and blurred vision for 1-3 days after.	NEGATIVE
Usually i am battling fatigue and aches on a regular basis, but it gets a lot worse after any exertion.	NEGATIVE
All blood work comes back normal.	POSITIVE

Did you ever get a doctors response?	NEUTRAL
Try eliminating sugars / Doing so saved my joints.	POSITIVE
i am in my 30s and i have had moderate / sever ulcerative colitis for 9 years and about 2 or 3 years after my first symptoms I started experiencing severe joint pain that would migrate from joint to joint (knees, knuckles, shoulders, toes, ankles, inner hip/groin, as well as in my back and chest muscles.	NEGATIVE
The pain would last severely in one joint/area for a 1-4 days often being debilitating (sleepless nights, extreme pain, inability to use joint, sometimes, hot swollen joint) then would travel to another joint usually then travel to the other or go dormant for a time then flair up again.	NEGATIVE
After almost giving up on trying to fix the problem I saw a pattern (a few days after gorging on Halloween candy) that the flairs were directly associated with my consumption of processed sugars.	NEUTRAL
It was amazing after cutting candy, soda, and high fructose corn syrup and other processed sugars out of my diet for about a month the joint pain stopped completely.	POSITIVE
I found can eat natural sugars no problem such as in fruit and juice and have no problem.	POSITIVE
Once again the pain literally stopped after about a month and has not returned for now years.	POSITIVE
However, if I stray and start to each too much processed sugars I can feel it creeping in once in full force for a time after straying from my strict no sugar rule).	NEGATIVE
Those little reminders and one large reminder have allowed me to stay ``"bad"'' sugar free and pain free.	NEUTRAL
Before when I had the pain I used high and low doses of prednizone but even prednizone did not completely help me.	NEGATIVE
It was not until I stopped the sugar and stayed off it that I found relief.	POSITIVE
Also, i have been able to stay predizone free as well).	POSITIVE
Although my colitis is still an issue (mostly managed by Asocal / Asathiaprine) the joint pain is past.	NEUTRAL
I hope this helps and I highly recommend you try this as it saved me so much pain.	POSITIVE
On a related note I also try to stay away from too much fake sugars (diet drinks, etc) as I have found that these have caused me some trouble although not nearly as much as processed sugars.	NEUTRAL

Anyway my question is are there any other women experiencing a little bit of HAIR LOSS as I find my hair is thinning around my crown abit, and my part seems to be widening.	NEUTRAL
I am the type of person who is also a worrier and a stresshead at times, so I do not know whether it is to do with that as well.	NEUTRAL
Anyway it would be great if you could let me know.	POSITIVE
Ask for a hormone test.	NEUTRAL
Your hair loss does not have to be a part of the UC.	NEUTRAL
In any case patchy hair loss is a symptom that should be looked into.	NEUTRAL
I am a hairdresser and I have noticed that women with UC because of lack of nutrion lose Can have hair loss.	NEUTRAL
You do not absorb enough vitiamns.	NEGATIVE
So you might want to take some.	NEUTRAL
Also it could be hormones like was suggested or it could be a thyroid problem.	NEUTRAL
If you are stressed a lot its likely to be that also.	NEUTRAL
When you get stressed your scalp tightens up and it cuts the circulation off to the hair follicals and your hair can get dry and brittle.	NEUTRAL
so stimulation to the scalp helps hair growth and health.	NEUTRAL
You might have some blood work next time you go to the doctor just to rule out all the other stuff mentioned.	NEUTRAL

However, I have just started to notice what you mention.	NEUTRAL
Widening part, small bald patch at the crown.	NEGATIVE
This does concern me!	NEGATIVE
I think vitamin supplements are worth starting and will do that right away.	NEUTRAL
I have also read articles about lack of iron leading to hair loss - but do not you think my twice daily iron supplement would prevent this?	NEUTRAL
In any case, I would be interested to know if you find something that works and Ill do the same.	NEUTRAL
I have had marijuana hair loss in the same pattern (i feel like i have little bald devil horns and i am going to need a wig soon!) and have also always had TONS of hair and stress so I did iron/multvitamin and other vitamin regimens for the last 2 years straight, it has not helped my hair one bit.	NEGATIVE
I have tried being on anti-anxiety/anti-depressants to see if the lack of stress would help,1 year on those, no help at all.	NEGATIVE
Now my eyebrows are starting to go rapidly, the entire hair loss thing came on suddenly and like WiLdFiRe!	POSITIVE
Multiple doctors say they have no clue, a friend suggested I go see a Dermatologist, I do not *think* i have ever done a hormone test or if that would even provide a solution.I do not want to go bald and then find out what is wrong and then be told it is too late to really grow any of the hair back because of how long it is been happening for.Ya know?

Hi, I was diagnosed with UC over a year ago, and have gone through a plethora of different drugs to find something which works (relatively ...), among which Asacol and Prednisone, both of which are having a huge effect on my hair - that is I lose quite a lot.	NEGATIVE
I am quite young (22) so it has nothing to do with hormones etc.	NEUTRAL
My physician told me it was mostly stress (yes, like this is gonna na help...anyone with UC knows how stress is hard to control when you are sick and bothered about it!), but my hairdresser aunt actually gave me a great tip - Zinc!	POSITIVE
Generally I find that taking multi-vitamins help me, if only because I know with my bowel habits I do not absorb enough vitamins, but Zinc had a great effect on my hair.	POSITIVE
It is growing again so I am starting to get some thickness back, though I have illusions that it will be back to how it was before.	POSITIVE
Anyway, I took Zinc , 50mg tablets once a day, and in 1 week I felt a difference, and I stopped taking it and the hair still does not go off.	POSITIVE
It is worth a try at the very least then!	NEUTRAL
I have uc for 2 years i took the same medication for 45 days only, since then I have thin and dry hair.	NEGATIVE

Hair loss is a side effect from Mesalamine, which is an NSAID (non-steroid anti inflammatory).	NEGATIVE

I was taking my regular (doctor recommended) vitamins: fish oil, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, magnesium; and stopped taking them because I was tired of taking so many pills every day, along with Asacol.	NEGATIVE
